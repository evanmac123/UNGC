%p== Dear #{@user.name_with_title},

%p
  Thank you for submitting your Communication on Progress (COP). According to your self-assessment, your COP meets all minimum requirements and qualifies for the GC Active level.
  == Your COP and the self-assessment are now #{link_to "publicly available", show_cops_url(differentiation: @cop.differentiation_level_with_default, id: @cop)} on the Global Compact website.

- if @cop.additional_questions && @cop.differentiation == 'active'
  %p Although you attempted to submit a COP for the GC Advanced level, your COP is missing one or more required elements:
  = render :partial => '/shared/cops/cop_missing_advanced_criteria', :locals => { :communication_on_progress => @cop }

%p The Global Compact encourages participants with GC Active COPs to improve policy implementation and increase transparency in order to progress toward achieving GC Advanced status for the next COP.

%p== The #{link_to 'GC Advanced', advanced_cop_submission_guide_url} level aims to create a higher standard for corporate sustainability performance and disclosure based on the #{link_to 'Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership', 'http://unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/Blueprint.pdf'} and the #{link_to 'UN Global Compact Management Model', 'http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/9.1_news_archives/2010_06_17/UN_Global_Compact_Management_Model.pdf'}.

%p Companies have an opportunity to identify themselves as "GC Advanced" by demonstrating that they have adopted, and report on, policies and processes in the following areas:

%ul
  %li Corporate Sustainability Governance & Leadership
  %li Implementing the Ten Principles into Strategies & Operations in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment, Anti-Corruption
  %li UN goals and issues

%p== We look forward to receiving your next COP by #{dd_month_yyyy Date.today + 1.year} and hope that you will consider participating at the GC Advanced level.

%p Sincerely,
%p
  The COP Team
