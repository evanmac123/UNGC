Dear Contact Points for
%strong== #{@organization.name}:

%p== We would like to follow up on our previous message and remind you that the deadline for submitting your company's annual Communication on Progress (COP) to the UN Global Compact website is in 30 days on #{dd_month_yyyy @organization.cop_due_on}.

%p Please note that if a company fails to submit a COP by its due date, it will be listed as "Non-communicating" on our website's public list of participants and on the companyâ€™s individual UN Global Compact page.

%p==For your convenience, at the end of this email, you will find a list of tools and resources that can help you in drafting and submitting your COP. In case you have forgotten your password, please use the #{link_to 'Forgot your username or password', 'http://unglobalcompact.org/password/new'} link to request a new one.

%p== If you require additional time to prepare your COP, and if you have not requested a grace period within the last three months, you can submit a #{link_to 'Grace Letter', 'http://unglobalcompact.org/docs/communication_on_progress/Grace_Letter_Step_by_Step_Guide.pdf'} through the Global Compact website, extending your deadline by 90 days. In order to maintain your "Active" status and to avoid becoming "Non-communicating" during this grace period, the letter must be submitted before your deadline.

%p
  ==If you have any questions related to your COP or to any other aspect of your participation in the UN Global Compact, please do not hesitate to contact your Relationship Manager, #{@organization.participant_manager_name} at #{mail_to @organization.participant_manager_email.to_s}.

  - if @organization.network_report_recipients.any?
    == Additionally, your Local Network contact point, #{@organization.network_report_recipient_name} in #{@organization.country_name}, copied on this email, would be happy to provide you with further support and information.

  We look forward to the timely submission of your COP.


%p Sincerely,

%p
  Transparency and Disclosure Team
