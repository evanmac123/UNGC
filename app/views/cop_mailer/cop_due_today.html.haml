To all Contact Points for
%strong== #{@organization.name}:

%p We would like to inform you that we have not yet received your company's latest Communication on Progress (COP), which is due today. Unless you submit a COP within the 30-day grace period beginning today, your company will be identified as 'non-communicating' on the Global Compact website. This is an automatic sanction in line with the Global Compact's integrity measures.

%p As you know, the Global Compact requires participating companies annually to develop a COP in order to promote transparency and accountability, to stimulate dialogue and learning, and to showcase good practices. Our COP policy stipulates that companies communicate publicly to their stakeholders on progress made in implementing the Global Compact's ten principles - through their annual reports, sustainability reports and other prominent communications vehicles and channels.

%p
  We hope that your failure to submit a COP was simply an oversight and that we will receive a COP from you soon. We offer a number of free guidance tools to assist you in the communication process. You can find them on our website at

%p Please note that companies that are marked as 'non-communicating' for one year will be removed entirely from the Global Compact database of active participants. This means that they can neither participate in Global Compact events nor use the Global Compact logo.

%p If you have further questions on the COP policy and process, please contact our COP Analyst at cop@unglobalcompact.org. Your input can help the Global Compact Office gain a better understanding of the challenges participants face in implementing the principles and in communicating progress.

%p We look forward to hearing from you soon.

%p Sincerely,

%p The Global Compact Office
