Dear Contact Points for
%strong== #{@organization.name},

%p== As of #{dd_month_yyyy @organization.cop_due_on} 23:00 UTC, your company is listed as "Non-communicating" on the UN Global Compact website for failure to submit a COP by the deadline. After a one-year "Non-communicating" period, a company will be automatically expelled from the UN Global Compact. To regain your company’s "Active" status, you will need to submit your COP through our website. 

%p== For your reference, at the end of this email you will find a list of resources that can help you in drafting and submitting your company’s COP. In case you have forgotten your password, please use the #{link_to 'Forgot your username or password', 'http://unglobalcompact.org/password/new'} link to request a new one.

  == If you have any questions related to your COP or to any other aspect of your participation in the UN Global Compact, please do not hesitate to contact your Relationship Manager, #{@organization.participant_manager_name} at #{mail_to @organization.participant_manager_email.to_s}.
