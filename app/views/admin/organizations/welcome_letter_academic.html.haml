%p Thank you for writing the Secretary-General to express your organization&rsquo;s commitment to advance the Global Compact&rsquo;s principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. We applaud your leadership in making this decision and welcome your organization&rsquo;s engagement in the Global Compact &ndash; the world&rsquo;s largest corporate citizenship initiative, with thousands of business participants and other stakeholders from civil society, labour and government based in over 160 countries.

%p At the heart of the Global Compact is a conviction that business practices which are rooted in universal principles help the global marketplace to be more socially and economically inclusive, thus advancing collective goals of international cooperation, peace and development. Indeed, companies and other organizations participating in the Global Compact are working diligently to give concrete meaning to this principle-based change approach.

%p From the beginning, the Global Compact has considered the active engagement of non-business stakeholders a critical factor for making real progress. Your participation helps to foster this collaborative spirit which is so critical for tackling today&rsquo;s challenges.

%p Academic institutions have a unique role to play in advancing the Global Compact. For example, by undertaking research on the evolving issue of corporate citizenship, academic findings can serve to underpin more effective policies and practices. And, by developing case studies related to corporate efforts to implement universal principles, academics can further strengthen the business case for responsible practices. Perhaps most importantly, academics can better equip our leaders of tomorrow with the knowledge and tools they will need to adequately meet pressing global challenges.

%p Therefore, we encourage you to show your commitment to the Global Compact by taking strategic actions in one or more of the following areas: educating responsible leaders, advancing relevant research, disseminating international values of corporate citizenship, giving technical support to responsible business, or lending capacity to Global Compact Local Networks.

%p.new_page Business schools and management-related academic institutions are also encouraged to join the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative. The responsible education principles provide an engagement framework <em>specifically</em> for academic institutions to advance corporate responsibility through the incorporation of universal values into curricula and research. Over 100 academic institutions around the world have joined. More information can be found in the enclosed PRME brochure.

%p As a voluntary initiative, the Global Compact draws strength from our participants&rsquo; commitment and actions. To spur implementation and progress, we provide various learning and engagement opportunities for signatories. These include: 80-plus country and regional networks where issues and activities are driven at a local level; practical tools and guidance documents on the principles and other priority issues; and international and local events where multi-stakeholder participants can exchange experiences, partake in learning and problem-solving exercises, engage in dialogue and identify like-minded organizations for partnering projects.

%p Further details on such activities can be found in the attached guidance document, &ldquo;After the Signature: A Guide to Engagement in the United Nations Global Compact&rdquo; and on the Global Compact website (www.unglobalcompact.org).

%p Credibility and accountability are critical factors for advancing the Global Compact. We encourage all organizations engaged in the initiative to communicate with their stakeholders about efforts to promote the initiative&rsquo;s ten principles and to engage in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. To start, your organization may wish to inform stakeholders &ndash; such as students, employees and partners &ndash; and the general public about your decision to support the Global Compact.

%p Again, we thank you for joining the Global Compact. We are eager to hear your ideas and experiences, and encourage you to share your views with us. We stand ready to support your efforts to embrace the ten universal principles and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.
