%p== As of 1 October 2014, all UN Global Compact participants that have signed the CEO Statement of Support for the #{popup_link_to 'Women\'s Empowerment Principles', 'http://weprinciples.org/'}  will have the opportunity to answer 4 new gender specific questions, aligned with the WEPs, as part of their self-assessment when submitting their Communication on Progress (COP). For questions or concerns, please contact #{mail_to 'womens-empowerment-principles@unglobalcompact.org'}.

%p The following gender related COP Self-Assessment questions encourage and support companies to report on their progress towards implementing the Women’s Empowerment Principles.

%p== #{popup_link_to 'Women’s Empowerment Principle 7', 'http://weprinciples.org/Site/Principle7/'} highlights the importance of using sex-disaggregated data to measure and report on progress. The final question on sex-disaggregated data refers to data that is collected and presented separately on women and men. It is quantitative statistical information on the differences and inequalities between men and women.
