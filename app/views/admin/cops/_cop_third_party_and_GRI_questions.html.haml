High-quality external assessment should ideally encompass qualitative and quantitative information and performance data in the COP, as well as an explanation of the management systems and processes that foster their credibility.<br /><br />A credible third-party is defined as groups or individuals external to the reporting organization who are demonstrably competent in the subject matter and eligible to provide feedback on the basis of their role towards the company and their independent position. For guidance on the assurance process, companies may refer to #{popup_link_to 'Your Path to External Assessment', 'https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/531'}.
