%h2 Submit your Grace Letter:

%p By clicking on the 'Submit' button on the right, you will publish your Grace Letter on our website.

%p The Global Compact Office will accept a Grace Period Letter instead of a Communication on Progress (COP) when a participant commits to submit a COP within a maximum of 90 days. The Grace Period Letter must explain both <strong>why</strong> the COP is delayed in its production as well as the <strong>date</strong> you expect to have it completed by.
