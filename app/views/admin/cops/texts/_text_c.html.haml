%p Thank you for submitting your company&#x27;s Communication on Progress (COP) to the United Nations Global Compact website. Unfortunately, we are unable to publish it to the Global Compact website because it does not meet the requirements defined in our Global Compact&rsquo;s subsidiary engagement policy. 

%p Companies joining the Global Compact commit to implementing the ten principles within their sphere of influence. They are expected to undertake continuous and comprehensive efforts to advance the principles wherever they operate and work toward a globally coherent approach to corporate responsibility.

%p As you are submitting the COP of your parent company, this COP must also describe the efforts made by your subsidiary to implement the Global Compact principles. Your COP should make specific reference to your country of operation and your operations should be included in the data coverage provided in your parent company&#x27;s COP.	

%p We kindly invite you to re-submit your COP once the requested changes are made. 

%p Many thanks for all you do to support the UN Global Compact.  

%p The Global Compact Office
