          %span General Information
        %p
          Using this online questionnaire, you will have the opportunity to assess that your COP describes your company's implementation of the <em>Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership</em>. 
        %p
          Similar to the self-assessment of the Advanced Level, by confirming that your company implements at least one best practice under each of the first 24 criteria, you will meet the requirements of the first dimension of the "Blueprint Implementation of 10 Global Compact Principles" and the "Cross-cutting" components of governance leadership, stakeholder engagement and transparency and disclosure.  
        %p Additionally, under the "UN Goals" and "Global Compact" sections you will be asked to confirm that your COP describes each of the additional 20 criteria for LEAD companies related to taking action in support UN Goals and Engagement with the Global Compact.
        %p At the end of the questionnaire, you will be asked to confirm that, based on the self-assessment, your company meets all 24 GC Advanced criteria and that the COP describes implementation of all 24 criteria and relevant best practices selected in the self-assessment.
        %ul.bulleted
          %li If you confirm that you meet each of the criteria of the Advanced Level and the additional 20 criteria under &ldquo;UN Goals&rdquo; and &ldquo;Global Compact&rdquo; your COP will qualify for the Blueprint level and meet the minimum requirement for LEAD companies.  The results of the self-assessment will be made public on the Global Compact website, alongside your COP.
          %li
            If you cannot confirm, the COP will be submitted but the company will not meet the minimum criteria for LEAD. An email will be sent to the LEAD team notifying that an incomplete COP has been submitted. You will then have 3 months to resubmit. However, the results of the self-assessment will be made public on the Global Compact website, alongside the COP, to improve the searchability and analysis of the COPs and underlying performance.
