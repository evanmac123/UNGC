    %p==Please note that all companies requesting permission to use the "we support" logo are required to (1) Have active COP status and (2) Ensure their annual contribution to the UN Global Compact (either via the Foundation for the Global Compact or via their Global Compact Local Network) is up to date in order to support the important work of the UN Global Compact. Contributions from companies like yours are vital to the initiative's ability to provide a robust framework for corporate change and innovation around environmental, social and governance issues.

    %p== Please review the #{popup_link_to 'Global Compact Logo Policy','/AboutTheGC/Global_Compact_Logo/GC_Logo_Policy.html'} before submitting a request. To illustrate how the Global Compact logo will be used in your communication materials, please prepare a sample, mock up, or screenshot. For this purpose, a Global Compact logo with a 'sample' watermark is available on the Logo Policy page.

  %li
    %p Upload a sample of your publication. For print publications, you may upload only those pages in which the logo will appear. If the logo is to be used on a website, a screen capture illustrating the logo's placement can be submitted.

  %li
    %p Each publication must be submitted as a separate request. For example, a request to use the logo on your organization's website must be requested separately from a request to use the logo in a print publication.
