  %p Each established Local Network is required to sign an Annual Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Global Compact Office confirming authorization to use the name "Global Compact" as part of the network's name and to use the Global Compact Network logo in connection with the network's activities. This annual reconfirmation is based on the understanding that the Local Network will continue to engage in activities that are consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Global Compact.
