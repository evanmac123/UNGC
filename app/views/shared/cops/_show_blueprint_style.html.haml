          %dt.first Missing or<br />incomplete criteria
          %dd.first
            = render :partial => '/shared/cops/cop_missing_advanced_criteria', :locals => { :communication_on_progress => communication_on_progress }

      %p Through the GC Advanced level, the Global Compact Office recognizes companies that strive to be top reporters and declare that they have adopted and report on a broad range of best practices in sustainability governance and management.

      %p The Global Compact is currently working with long-term investors (through the Principles for Responsible Investment) and financial information service providers (Bloomberg L.P.) to disseminate this information throughout the financial community, thus increasing visibility and recognition.

      %p We hope that the COP self-assessment can also serve as a roadmap to guide your actions for the upcoming year and ensure your company continues to progress towards implementing all relevant best practices of the GC Advanced level, following the Global Compact's Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership.

      %p We look forward to your continued participation in the Global Compact at the GC Advanced level.
