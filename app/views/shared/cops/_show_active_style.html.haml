    %p The Global Compact encourages GC Active participants to improve policy implementation and increase transparency in order to progress toward submitting a GC Advanced COP for the next reporting period.
    %p The GC Advanced level aims to create a higher standard for corporate sustainability performance and disclosure based on the Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership and the UN Global Compact Management Model.
    %p Companies have an opportunity to identify their COPs as GC Advanced by demonstrating that they have adopted, and report on, policies and processes in the following areas:

    %ul.bulleted
      %li Corporate Sustainability Governance & Leadership
      %li
        Implementing the Ten Principles into Strategies & Operations in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption
      %li UN goals and issues

    %p== We look forward to receiving your next COP by #{dd_month_yyyy communication_on_progress.published_on + 1.year} and hope that you will consider reporting at the GC Advanced level.
