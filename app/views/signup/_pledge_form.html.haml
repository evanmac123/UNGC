%p All companies are expected to commit to making annual contributions to support the work of the UN Global Compact Office. This revenue is critically important with respect to the development of value-maximizing programmes, projects and resources for the benefit of all participating companies. These fees are received, and the money deployed, through the Foundation for the Global Compact &ndash; a non-profit 501(c)(3) &ndash; and are therefore tax deductible in many jurisdictions. The annual fees are set as follows:
