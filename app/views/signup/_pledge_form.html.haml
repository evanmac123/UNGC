%p All companies are asked to make a regular annual contribution to support the work of the UN Global Compact Office. This revenue is critical to the development of value-maximizing programmes, projects and resources for the benefit of all participating companies. These contributions are received, administered and distributed through the Foundation for the Global Compact - a non-profit 501(c)(3) - and are therefore tax deductible in many jurisdictions. We have highlighted the amount of your annual contribution.
