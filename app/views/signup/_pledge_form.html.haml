%p All companies are expected to make a regular annual contribution to support the work of the UN Global Compact Office. This revenue is critical to the development of value-maximizing programmes, projects and resources for the benefit of all participating companies. These fees are received, administered and distributed through the Foundation for the Global Compact - a non-profit 501(c)(3) - and are therefore tax deductible in many jurisdictions. The annual fees are set as follows:
