Dear Contact Points for
%strong== #{@organization.name},

%p== This is a friendly reminder to submit your organization's Communication on Engagement #{link_to 'COE', 'https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/1861'} to the UN Global Compact website by #{dd_month_yyyy @organization.coe_due_on}.

%p== Organizations that fail to submit a COE by the due date will be listed as “Non-communicating” on our website’s public list of participants and on the organization’s individual UN Global Compact page.

%p== For your convenience, at the end of this email, you will find a list of tools and resources that can help you in drafting and submitting your COE.
%p== In case you have forgotten your password, please use the #{link_to 'Forgot your username or password', 'http://unglobalcompact.org/password/new'} link to request a new one. For your convenience, at the end of this email, you will find a list of tools and resources that can help you in drafting and submitting your COE.

%p== If you require additional time to prepare your COE, and if you have not requested a grace period within the last three months, you can submit a #{link_to 'Grace Letter', 'https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/2941'} through the Global Compact website, extending your deadline by 90 days. In order to maintain your “Active” status and to avoid becoming “Non-communicating” during this grace period, the letter must be submitted before your COE deadline.
