Data Migration
==============

We created two classes in the lib/ folder that read create a database in our format from UNGC data
To run those files, go to a console and:
>> Importer.new.run
>> HabtmImporter.new.run

Be patient, each run will take around 10 minutes :)

Application setup
=================

Make sure you run Ruby 1.9.1!
rvm - http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ - makes installing multiple Ruby versions extremely easy.

sudo gem install rvm
rvm-install
rvm use 1.9.1 - this will download and install ruby 1.9
rvm 1.9.1 --default - this will make the downloaded 1.9 the default in your computer
At this point, you get new executables for gem, irb and ruby, and have to install all gems again.
Make sure you never run the "sudo" command before installing any of the gems.

If you are setting up this application for the first time in you machine, follow the steps below:

cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
rake gems:install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
./script/server

Done :)
