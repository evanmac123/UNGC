# Monitoring
# Performance

* we can then group and evaluate the coverage of each implementation category

* after making the change in the database, a user function was created to make this change

* for pending organizations, we like to know if there are possible duplicate applications being submitted

* their value will depend on whether the question is answered

h1. 2010-08-10

* COP scoring now only takes the number of questions at time of submission, instead of getting all of the questions.
* It's possible that new questions will be added, so we don't want previous submissions to have lower scores as a result

h1. 2010-08-02

* Should be easier for less advanced ESG reports to submit a COP
