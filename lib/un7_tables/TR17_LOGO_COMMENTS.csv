We would appreciate if you could replace the word 'member' to 'participant'.  The UN Global
Compact is not a membership initiative, or rather a network initiative in which companies commit themselves to making progress within their business operation in the areas of the ten
principles.  The Global Compact is entirely about companies that are willing to participate in learning and dialogue, and is not a leadership or membership initiative by which the Global Compact endorses or certifies participating companies as members.  Therefore, it is important that the Global Compact participants identify themselves as 'participating' or 'making commitment' to the initiative.  Thank you for your understanding."

1. Could you move the GC logo to the right side of your own logo, rather than on the left?
2. It is not clear what 'in Registers' means.  If you could make it something like 'A Participant at the UN Global Compact', that would sound much more coherent with what we normally describe our participants.
3. As you selected that this is for your website, do you have URL address for this page?  Could you also share it with us?

Thank you in advance for your cooperation."

We provide clarify to your comments as follows:
Reply:

1.No issue we shall move the logo to  the right side.
2.We think your are quite right. We will mention ourselves as 'Participants at the UN Global Compact"" in all our future print material, communications etc.
3.Yes, we have our site:
www.missions3g-gauri.org.
Sure this clarify your concerns.

We are conscious and responsible for focused use of the Logo to take the campaign in our networks to maximise  the impact on all we deal with.

We look forward for necessary approval for the use of Logo i.e. ""We Support"".

Thanks for the cooperation.

As for your slide, we would like to have more clarification. With the GC logo and 10 principles, I assume that your intention for the whole page is to show your commitment to the GC and other initiatives, right?  If this is correct, we would like to suggest that you would use the ""We support the Global Compact"" logo in the slide and change the heading to 'Principles' or 'Global Compact's 10 Principles'.  This way, it would be clearer and more consistent with us in terms of the language that we use.  Please let us know what you think. "

Thank you for getting back to us to promptly.
The intention of our slide is to illustrate how our product (the scorecard displayed at the bottome of the mock up) supports corporate commitments to the UNGC.  As a baseline requirement all sustainability scorecards deployed through our software (TCN.C5) must be populated with indicators that satisfy UNGC COP requirements and GRI.
Our CEO is meeting with Georg Kell and Sean Gilbert of GRI on Wednesday and this is a document that will be presented in draft form.
Please let me know your feedback given what is explained above. "

Thought I would also add that the title ""The Continuum Network - Sustainability Management and Reporting Solutions"" is actually the title of our overview presentation.  The particular slide mock up we have submitted is a single slide within that... with no particular heading. Although we are definitely open to suggestions.
Thanks!"
283,2009-03-24 11:56:39,130,93876823,"Thank you for using the GC logo in your newsletter. There are some points we would like to clarify as below.

1. We have noticed that the GC is mentioned in the page 14 of the newsletter.  Is this page where the GC logo is to be included?

2. Steria S.A. joined the GC in 2004, and the GC was formally launched in 2000.  Therefore, in order to deliver the correct message, you would need some adjustment in the text, e.g. 'Steria has signed the UN Global
Compact in 2004, which was initiated (or created) in 2000 to bring companies together....'.  Please let us know if this is acceptable.

3. If you want to use the GC logo in your website as a stand-alone file, not as a part of newsletter, you would need to make a separate request for it.  Please note that the GC logo policy requires us to review samples/drafts of every single use of the GC logo by our participants.  Thanks for your understanding."

Based on your explanation, I think this is okay to use the GC logo in your presentation slide.  However, what concerns me is the word 'Practice' below the GC logo.  Is there any way you can make a distinction that the wording is not part of the GC?  Probably if you could put the GC logo and 10 principles in some kind of box, and then put the wording next to the box.  Would this work for you?  Thanks for your cooperation."

Upon its participation in the Global Compact, the Sumitomo Corporation Group committed itself to make further improvements by constantly assessing enhancements of its business activities in light of the values advocated by the 10 principles.

The Global Compact (GC) was proposed by the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan at the World Economic Forum (in Davos) in 1999 and officially launched in 2000 at the UN Headquarters in New York. The GC is an initiative aimed at realizing the sustainable growth of the global economy through the voluntary participation of businesses in a worldwide network. The UN invites companies and organizations from around the world to join in the GC and currently has about 6,700 companies and organizations from 129 countries participating. The GC has compiled 10 universal principles recognized by the international community based on international agreements in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Participating companies adopt the 10 principles into their business operations and strategies and are expected to assume responsible and creative leadership as a good corporate citizen for the purpose of achieving sustainable growth.

1. UNGC logo cannot be modified in any case and cannot be put together with other wordings.  Therefore, 'Medlem af...' under the GC logo should be removed; and the endorser logo should be used instead.
2. The color is not acceptable as well.  IIt should be UNGC blue primarily, but if necessary black or white (negative) is acceptable.  In your case, I guess black would work the best.

A barrier-free mark (a yellow circle) on the film helps to grasp the direction (up or down) and speed of escalators, so UD Esca contributes to the decrease of accidents where people fall off an escalator or take a wrong one, regardless of their disability, nationality and age.

There are about 70,000 escalators in Japan, and the number is increasing year by year with promotion of the barrier-free facilities. Unfortunately, escalators are one of facilities which seriously bring many accidents, so we have developed ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“UD(Universal Design) EscaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â as a media which contributes to safely-mobile life of elderly people and people with visual impairments and mental disabilities.

We have reviewed the content of the brochure and would like to request you to make two changes.

1. 2-B item on page 2
We find that the first sentence, starting with ' Your corporation's name...', is not clear and could imply that your sponsors' logos will be presented at the UN Global Compact forums as sponsors, which is incorrect.  Thus, we request you to clarify the language in that respect, or remove the 'UN Global Compact forums' from the item.

2. Third item of More about EVE-olution
We noticed that it is stated that your organization is a member of the UN Global Compact, while this should be a participant. The Global Compact is entirely about companies/organizations that are willing to participate in learning and dialogue, and is not a leadership or membership initiative by which the Global Compact endorses or certifies participating companies/organizations as members. Therefore, we ask you to identify yourself as a 'participant' in the initiative.

Please let us know if these two changes are acceptable.  Thank you."

If you want to keep the current design, the slight change we would request you to make is move the GC logo to the right bottom side, probably used in negative (white color) and insert some wording like ""We are committed to the UN Global Compact"".  In that case, it would be clear that your company supports the GC.  Or, if you have any other suggestions, please let us know.  Thank you very much."

Please have a look at different kinds of the GC logos (http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/logo_policy/Logo_Use_Guidance_for_Local_Networks.pdf), and let us know whether you want to use the We Support logo or the local network logo.

Here clients, journalists and other people interested in Crowne Plaza Copenhagen Towers can find facts about us and our services and read about our values, our CSR policy and our work for e.g. the environment and labour rights.
The screen shot of the GC website is an idea from our marketing agency  - it should be used along with a text tell about our engagement in Global Compact and our work to fulfill the 10 GC principles. It will be a teaser on the front page for some weeks, after that it can be found in our news archive. Preferably we would like to have the GC logo on our website permanently. Visitors clicking on this will be linked to the GC website where thay can read more about the GC and find our COP.

Just a few points: first, the logo that is currently displayed on the page is an old version of the regular GC logo. Please note that the permission to use the regular GC logo is given only when the Global Compact Office is directly involved in the projected activities.  Therefore, we can only provide you with the endorser (We Support) logo. In all materials, the endorser logo must appear in isolation, uncluttered by competing images.

Second, because you have listed the 10 principles in a separate section, the use of the regular logo IS allowed but only in relation to the image of the 10 principles.

Thirdly, we noticed that it is stated that your company is a member of the UN Global Compact, while this should be a participant. The Global Compact is entirely about organizations that are willing to participate in learning and dialogue, and is not a leadership or membership initiative by which the Global Compact endorses or certifies participating entities as members. Therefore, we ask you to identify yourself as 'participating' in the initiative.

For more information on the policy on the use of the UN Global Compact logos, please visit our website at http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/Global_Compact_Logo/GC_Logo_Policy.html.

Please let me know if these changes would be acceptable.

However, because the Global Compact was not actually involved in the development of these materials, we cannot grant permission to use our logo as proposed. Before we can grant any logo usage, we would ask that you change the materials in several small but important ways.

First, because the Global Compact was not actually a co-developer of this training material, we would prefer if you did not include our logo on every page of the slides. Rather, placing our logo on the first or last page alone would be preferable.

Second, for these purposes, we can only provide the endorser logo (""We Support""). We cannot grant use of the regular logo with the words ""Supported by"" as currently used and we ask that you remove that language.

Third, we would prefer if you placed the logos on the front slide, the certificate, and the front page of the manual in a less prominent position, perhaps in the lower corner. This is to make clear that the materials were not in co-authored or otherwise endorsed by the Global Compact. Moreover, it will be clearer that the ""We"" in ""We Support"" refers to the JCI.

We hope these changes are acceptable. If you accept these recommendations, we will be able to provide you with higher-quality endorser logos. Please contact us if you have any questions. Thank you."

The sample you provided appears to be the main page of your website. If that is the case, we have no problems with granting permission to use the endorser (""We Support"") logo.

The Global Compact is entirely about organizations that are willing to participate in learning and dialogue, and is not a leadership or membership initiative by which the Global Compact endorses or certifies participating entities as members. Therefore, we ask you to not use the GC logo in any page/section dealing with memberships or certificates.
