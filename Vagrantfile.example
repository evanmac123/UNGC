  # If your host machine supports NFS you can tell Vagrant to use it for the
  # shared folder which will greatly decrease IO latency, however, you will also
  # have to enable a host-only network for your host to communicate with your
  # VM, uncommenting the `config.vm.network` line above to do that. In order to
  # enable NFS, simply add nfs: true as the third argument to the
  # `synced_folder` directive above, so it looks like this:
  #
  # config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', nfs: true
