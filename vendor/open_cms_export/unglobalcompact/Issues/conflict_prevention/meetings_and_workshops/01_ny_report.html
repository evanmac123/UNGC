          <H1>The Role of the Private Sector in Zones of Conflict&nbsp;</H1>
<H2>21-22 March 2001 United Nations Headquarters&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<H3>Opening Remarks </H3>
<P>This first Policy Dialogue of the UN Global Compact (GC) on the role of the 
private sector in zones of conflict addresses a theme requested by the GC 
members themselves. Conflict is fundamentally a problem of failed governance. 
Both the private sector and the UN prefer not to interfere in domestic political 
affairs, but current civil conflicts pose new challenges. GC members need to 
identify specific measures they can take in a multi-stakeholder partnership that 
will create pockets of global civil society to underpin the global economy and 
promote peace.</P>
<P>Both business and civil society groups can have a role in mitigating 
conflict.. With this in mind, the GC Dialogue could discuss models such as the 
US-UK Security Agreement and the Chad-Cameroon pipeline project; and it could 
explore issues of transparency and accountability, the use of conflict impact 
assessments, and the link between environment and security. All of these require 
collective action and partnership to resolve problems effectively.</P>
<H3>Summary of Participant Discussion</H3>
<H4>Comments by Business Representatives </H4>
<P>The private sector has come a long way from the days when words about social 
responsibility were just a public relations tool. There is no place, 
particularly not in Africa, where conflict can be ignored. Business leaders are 
willing to work with other partners, especially in the development of incentives 
for individuals to avoid unethical behavior. Many business representatives 
believe that they need to act in collaboration with others, especially when they 
are uncertain about the appropriate response to a difficult situation. The GC is 
a model for this type of partnership, though it must demonstrate its value 
through concrete projects among GC members. Many GC business members can provide 
examples of their partnership projects around the world and in a variety of 
industry sectors. Lack of trust between business and NGOs can be a barrier to 
such partnerships. Some businesses stress that the core operations of an 
enterprise cannot be run as a philanthropy.</P>
<P>Risk management no longer can be confined to geological, technical, or 
financial risks, but now must include social, environmental, and security 
problems. Businesses cannot operate effectively in countries where the behavior 
of governments and other actors is unpredictable. The risk management process 
requires strong measures such as a statement of values (a corporate code), 
followed by initiatives that demonstrate commitment, and backed by monitoring 
and reporting. Measurement, evaluation, benchmarking and certification systems 
in areas such as human rights are still in their infancy and need to be better 
developed. Particular attention needs to be paid to the evaluation of the root 
causes of conflict including poverty, environmental degradation, and the uneven 
distribution of wealth, all of which must be included in risk management 
analysis. </P>
<P>Important as corporate social responsibility is in these areas, it must be 
sensitive to the danger of under-mining government responsibility, leading 
governments to become "decapacitated" in some ways. </P>
<P>The private sector needs to take concrete action in zones of conflict. 
Existing projects provide models for working closely with a community to 
overcome poverty, inequality, and mistrust thereby assisting in the task of 
prevention. The private sector can play a role in peace-building through 
implementing GC Principles. After a war, the private sector can cross the lines 
of conflict in an effort to rebuild, and can provide incentives for peace. 
Post-conflict investment involves identifying the relevant local business 
actors, demobilizing soldiers, providing compensation for destruction, and other 
tasks—and all of these require the participation of a number of groups.</P>
<H4>Comments by NGO Representatives</H4>
<P>NGOs are willing to work with business, and encourage them to adopt UN Global 
Compact Principles. They point out the danger of the "law of unintended 
consequences," i.e., that attempts by the private sector to pursue policies of 
social engagement, aid, and community development in zones of conflict can have 
unintended and unwelcome consequences. Businesses face special problems—adhering 
to local laws and to international conventions, in countries where corruption 
often is widespread. </P>
<P>Companies can act most effectively through partnership with NGOs, and through 
consortia of likeminded businesses. One business often can provide incentives 
for other businesses to act responsibly, for instance, through financial 
relationships. The key is to create a level playing field within the private 
sector, so that companies that fight corruption are not displaced by less 
ethical competitors. All partners should promote respect for the rule of law. 
The US-UK Security agreement is a good first step and model for partnership, as 
is the establishment of an international advisory group for the Chad-Cameroon 
project. NGOs often must proceed cautiously, however, since they can become 
targets in a conflict if they become identified too closely with a particular 
company.</P>
<P>Neither NGOs nor businesses have yet developed effective conflict impact 
assessment and management tools. Such tools and standards have to be implemented 
throughout the corporate organization, which can be difficult. </P>
<P>Transparency is a particularly important tool for the international community 
to use, especially for making corruption more difficult. In some countries, 
government officials cannot be held accountable and there is no press freedom. 
The IMF now focuses on the flow of revenue from investors to government 
officials, but this monitoring needs to be reinforced by external pressure, 
including pressure from the private sector. BP is to be commended for promising 
to publish information on their operations in Angola, but transparency should be 
adopted by groups of companies—even an entire industry—together. </P>
<P>Conflict often occurs over access to natural resources, which need to be 
governed better. Nevertheless, there exist important differences in the 
cultural, legal and regulatory frameworks of various countries. The GC Policy 
Dialogue could contribute to the Rio +10 meeting on this topic.</P>
<H4>Comments by Union Representatives</H4>
<P>Unions by their nature bring together workers from opposing sides of a 
conflict, and they can actively try to resolve divisive issues. They are open to 
working with business as partners. The US-UK Security Agreement, the Global 
Compact itself, and the recent agreement between ICEM and Statoil are all 
positive developments.</P>
<P>Both the possibility of unintended consequences of corporate action and the 
potential for undermining government capacity, pose real dilemmas for corporate 
social responsibility. However, this should not stop the private sector from 
engaging, and moving from dialogue to operationalization. </P>
<H4>Comments by United Nations Representatives</H4>
<P>Environmental degradation can create conflict, governance problems, even 
corruption. There has been a "greening of warfare" in recent years as the 
international community has become aware of the environmental causes and 
consequences of armed conflict. We need to develop a good conflict impact 
assessment system, particularly in the post-conflict phase, since otherwise it 
is difficult to evaluate conflicting complaints and resolve them.</P>
<H3>Working Groups</H3>
<P>Participants were divided into five groups based on themes from the 
discussion, and asked to answer four questions, keeping mind the different 
stages of conflict:</P>
<P>How might this issue contribute to conflict prevention or resolution? 
<BR>What are the arguments pro and con taking action on this issue? <BR>What 
types of action could be considered? <BR>What might be an agenda for a working 
group? <BR>Transparency:</P>
<P>Transparency is directly linked to accountability, and thus runs through all 
the stages of conflict. It is a practice that should be adopted by all 
actors—governments, multilateral institutions, corporations, civil society 
organizations—in order to reduce the potential for conflict and corruption.</P>
<P>We need to understand the incentives for different actors to be transparent. 
Different actors may be able to provide different kinds of information. For 
instance, companies should publish data on their payments to governments, as 
they do in the developed countries. The UN itself must become more transparent 
about its activities. Donor governments should provide public information about 
their aid programs and encourage their partners to be more transparent. NGOs 
should determine what level of transparency on their part might contribute to 
conflict mitigation. Nevertheless GC participants acknowledged that some 
information can and should be made public, while other information cannot be 
publicized.</P>
<P>This group proposed identifying key actors in zones of conflict and the types 
of information they could provide that might reduce or prevent conflict. The 
group also suggested developing a framework paper on the role of the financial 
sector in transparency initiatives. </P>
<H3>Collective Action</H3>
<P>Collective action is a value shared by both corporations and NGOs, although 
their motivations for it may be different. If we take the example of the health 
and pharmaceuticals sectors, one can see the importance of having more than one 
actor involved—banks, the World Bank, corporations, and NGOs. Collective action 
requires risk assessment, which often can become a sensitive issue for the 
government involved.</P>
<P>This group proposed developing a multi-stakeholder pilot project that would 
provide insight into how to assess and manage risk in collective efforts. Other 
organizations, including the World Bank, are developing conflict assessment 
tools, early warning systems, and risk analysis. These tools are only as good as 
the people that use them, and warnings in the past have often been ignored by 
corporations, multilateral institutions, and governments. The group also 
proposed establishing a website for providers of emergency services, for 
coordinating collective efforts among GC members, and to provide more 
information on models to follow. The group also suggested developing a joint 
venture in infrastructure reconstruction in post-conflict areas. </P>
<H3>Peace and Conflict Assessment and Risk Analysis</H3>
<P>Peace and conflict assessment and risk analysis can be used in all phases of 
conflict to ensure that investments do not make existing problems worse. A 
company should use comparable methodologies in every country in which they 
operate. The first step is to define risk itself—violent conflict, human rights 
violations, environmental risk, etc. The second step is to understand conflict 
and its various gradations. We need to look both at what might worsen 
conflict—and what might bring peace. These tools need to be used at the very 
beginning of an investment, in partnership with others and based on good 
community relations and widespread information-sharing among all participants. 
NGOs and corporate executives tend to speak a different language, and the 
process of developing and implementing these tools may provide a common 
framework of understanding. </P>
<P>Information from these assessments can be mis-used by different sides in a 
conflict, or it can simply persuade a company not to invest. But business can be 
a catalyst for change by using these tools and engaging others in the process. 
Actors who use such tools can increase business opportunities, help stabilize 
the political environment, and increase the sustainability of business itself. 
Peace and conflict impact assessments can promote participation by governments, 
corporations, and others by establishing incentives for all those involved. </P>
<P>This group proposed a number of projects. These include preparing material on 
the link between environment, security, and business for the Rio +10 meeting, 
and perhaps creating an exhibit there. The group suggested contributing to the 
Secretary-General's reports on conflict prevention. It also suggested that the 
GC members help develop business school curricula, with NetImpact—a virtual 
network of students at business schools—as a possible resource. </P>
<P>The group also suggested that GC members examine and compare different peace 
and conflict assessment tools and methodologies, and develop demonstration 
projects on how they work. The "Do No Harm" Principles developed for NGOs may be 
a model for the private sector to follow. The UN, through its global offices, 
could act as a broker and provider of information and lessons learned. The 
working group could share information, lessons learned, and already-existing 
mechanisms, and create a "toolbox" for others.</P>
<H3>Capacity Building</H3>
<P>Capacity building activities at the local level can prevent conflict by 
crossing conflict lines, broadening the basis for action among stakeholders, and 
strengthening legitimate voices in society. But in order to do capacity building 
you have to make sure the right people are at the table. Such initiatives can 
mis-fire, for instance, by weakening local government capacity. Different 
capacity-building programs might be best for one stage of conflict and not 
another. It can be difficult to ensure that resources get distributed to the 
right people. Corporations can face conflicting claims of legitimacy by NGOs, 
and need to identify the appropriate ones for partnership. Some GC NGO members 
could provide assistance in identifying appropriate partners. If done well, 
capacity-building programs can increase the security and credibility of the 
partners, and can prevent conflict if done at early stages of an emerging 
conflict.</P>
<P>Capacity-building can include programs to promote the equitable distribution 
of income, addressing poverty, supporting stakeholder dialogues, and pursuing 
joint peace and conflict analysis activities. Specific business projects, 
including micro-finance programs, can be structured to promote cooperation 
between different factions. The IFC has guides on community capacity-building 
that may be useful models. The World Bank will establish an Expert Panel to 
field test the IFC documents, particularly in the mining sector. The ILO has 
done extensive capacity building work and can offer its expertise.</P>
<P>Corporations also need to do internal capacity-building among their 
employees. Capacity-building programs should also aim to improve the ability of 
corporate managers to understand NGOs, and vice versa. </P>
<P>This group proposed developing principles for capacity-building, distilling 
experience from a variety of sources, and conducting pilot projects for GC 
members to demonstrate successful capacity-building models. They recommended 
analyzing a multi-stakeholder process, such as Chad-Cameroon, to evaluate its 
applicability elsewhere. The group also suggested developing learning circles 
within the business community in different regions, to develop internal 
capacity.</P>
<H3>Standards, Guidelines, Benchmarks and Measurement</H3>
<P>The differences among these must be clearly understood by all partners, as 
they have different meanings in different contexts. It is difficult to quantify 
many aspects of human rights, therefore hard to measure and benchmark. The 
Global Mining Initiative and the US-UK Security Agreement are positive models 
for GC members. </P>
<P>This group proposed researching and surveying different types and definitions 
of standards, guidelines, benchmarks and measurements. This should include a 
better understanding of their relationship to current law and regulation. The 
group also suggested looking at research on how corporations have internalized 
changes in law and regulation in the past, since this may provide insight into 
how they might internalize corporate social responsibility standards, 
guidelines, benchmarks and measurements. </P>
<H3>Closing Remarks and Follow Up Actions</H3>
<P>The objectives of business and NGOs are often far apart, and the GC can be a 
forum to bring them together. Collective action requires mutual understanding 
among participants, and that understanding still needs to be deepened. 
Engagement is a process, and we need to identify the case for participating in 
that process. </P>
<P>There was general agreement in the Policy Dialogue on the need to identify 
pilot projects with relevance to more than one working group. The participants 
suggested a number of specific research projects and favored developing a 
"toolbox" of peace and conflict assessment and risk management methodologies. 
The GC office will identify champions for these projects and provide assistance 
in setting up core working groups, but the process has to be led by the GC 
Policy Dialogue members themselves. Each core-working group will have 
representatives from business, labor and NGOs and they will be responsible for 
developing proposals to present to the larger group. The GC office will be 
consulting with participants and will be sending out a proposal on how to move 
forward.</P>
<P>We have a window of opportunity in which we can come to common themes, 
develop projects on the ground, and operationalize and test what we have 
developed here. <BR>We need to make substantive contributions to the important 
issues raised by the role of the private sector in zones of conflict. We also 
need to make a process contribution by demonstrating that a multi-stakeholder 
process can make a difference on the ground. </P>
