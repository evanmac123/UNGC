          <H1>The Role of the Private Sector in Zones of Conflict</H1>
<H2>17-18 April 2002, UN Headquarters New York&nbsp;</H2>
<H3>&nbsp;</H3>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The first meeting of the Global Compact policy dialogue on the Role of the 
Private Sector in Zones of Conflict took place in March of 2001. At that meeting 
representatives from companies, labour and NGOs identified four key issues in 
conflict prevention and peace building, for which they believed that a 
multistakeholder approach could be most effective. Four working groups were 
created to focus on these issues. In September of that year, participants came 
together to take stock of the work carried out up to that point and clearly 
define the outputs each group should complete by 2002. The working groups 
developed their work throughout the year by e-mails, phone conferences and 
face-to-face meetings. There are now 118 participants working together in this 
dialogue. On April 2002, a meeting was convened to present the outputs of each 
group and identify the actions needed to disseminate and implement the findings 
and recommendations. </P>
<P>The separate working groups presented their reports for discussion on the 
first day of the meeting. On the second day, they made recommendations for the 
next steps in the Dialogue. The following sections summarize those discussions 
and recommendations.</P>
<H3>The Working Group on Revenue-Sharing</H3>
<P>Members of this group presented a report that focused on the revenues 
generated by the natural resource extractive industry. Revenue-sharing regimes 
can have a variety of social and political objectives such as the just 
distribution of resources at the national, regional, and local levels; 
compensation for resettlement or loss of land; economic development and social 
investment; and meeting the needs of future generations. Revenue-sharing regimes 
can contribute to conflict prevention in two ways: first, they address questions 
of the equitable and just distribution of revenues; second, they require a 
process in which all stakeholders must work together with shared responsibility 
for investing revenues in projects that are sustainable and have a positive 
social impact. The group explored the different roles that corporations, host 
country governments, and the international community can have in developing 
revenue-sharing regimes. They emphasized the fact that different types of 
revenue-sharing mechanisms are possible, including government-controlled 
resource funds, transparent government funds, corporate-funded social investment 
funds, and funds managed with the participation of multilateral organizations. 
Revenue-sharing agreements can be a tool for achieving more transparency, more 
accountability and better governance</P>
<P>The discussion began with a comment on the fact that while there is a "sea 
change" in attitudes toward corporate responsibility, good government remains 
critical to development. Participants argued that the focus must be on 
developing government capacity and not on having companies deliver public goods 
– and revenue sharing-regimes can contribute to this goal. The group recommended 
the need to start with a better understanding of the different types of legal 
regimes and mechanisms for revenue distribution, considering that the legal 
framework is critical to any discussion of change. They suggested the need to 
consider not just the distribution but also the management of revenues, 
including issues of transparency, corruption, capacity building, and conflict. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Next steps:</STRONG> This group recommended that the UNGC should 
sponsor regional workshops on best practices in revenue-sharing regimes that 
might include one for the Caspian region, one in Nigeria in conjunction with the 
New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), and one in South Africa on 
mining and sustainable development. Local NGOs will be crucial to making such 
workshops successful. However, all agreed the resources of the UNGC are small 
and therefore these workshops would require partnerships with other 
organizations.</P>
<H3>The Working Group on Conflict Impact Assessment and Risk Management 
Toolbox</H3>
<P>The Working Group presented a report on the conflict impact assessment and 
prevention toolbox, now renamed the Business Guide. This is different from 
political risk and financial risk assessment, both of which focus on the effects 
of external factors on the company. The Guide is a practical approach for 
businesses to assess the impact of their own operations on local tensions, and 
vice versa. Assessing and understanding the various risks and responding with 
mindful solutions helps prevent the escalation of conflict. The Guide developed 
by the working group contains three sections: the Business Guide; a Stakeholder 
Analysis matrix; and annexes on impact assessment in Environment, Human Rights, 
Labour, and Humanitarian Law. The core of the document focuses on key areas of 
concern, including governance; economics; labor; security; and environment. </P>
<P>The discussion started with some concern that the Guide could be used as a 
screening device to determine implementation of the Global Compact principles. 
The Guide needs to be presented as a way to identify priority areas to apply the 
UNGC principles and not as a standard. Participants underlined the need to 
emphasize that the guide was designed to help find solutions. It should be 
designed in such a way that it does not present risks as being so complex as to 
discourage needed investment nor, alternatively, generate overly ambitious 
expectations for easy ready-made solutions. All agreed that civil society needed 
to be strengthened as a critical element of the investment environment. </P>
<P><STRONG>Next steps:</STRONG> This group suggested field testing the tools 
they have developed. The UNGC could identify 4-5 companies and NGOs to field 
test the Guide. The results could be a part of the Learning Forum, and posted to 
the web portal. The Guide should be publicized by the UNGC, perhaps through 
regional workshops. The Guide could also be publicized through chambers of 
commerce around the world; through the UNDP; and through industry associations 
and business leadership groups such as the Business Roundtable and Keidenran. 
The World Bank Business Partners for Development program already encourages 
investors to embed these kinds of assessments into their operations. Finally, 
the working group agreed to develop a 2-3 page summary of the business case for 
using this Guide. </P>
<H3>The Working Group on Transparency</H3>
<P>The working group on Transparency started from the position that transparency 
is an issue for all organizations, including companies, NGOs and international 
organizations. Issues raised by the working group included the kind of relevant 
data that might be made available; the appropriate balance between privacy and 
other values; and the appropriate mechanisms to evaluate information disclosed. 
Transparency is critical to enable organizations to decide where to invest human 
and financial capital, and it is vital to enhance credibility and trust. The 
pressure for transparency is driven by the Internet and globalization, and the 
associated rise in effective collective action campaigns. Some mechanisms of 
transparency include small-group meetings, community advisory panels, 
partnerships, and joint monitoring. In the financial sector, innovative 
practices include corporate public reporting on a variety of environmental, 
social, and ethical business activities; dialogue with stakeholders; interactive 
use of the Internet both to report information and collect responses; and 
disclosure of risk-assessment strategy. The working group emphasized the fact 
that transparency practices are best developed through a stakeholder process. 
</P>
<P>The recommendations of this group are directed at the different 
parties/actors. Civil society is an important constituency for accountability, 
and it should be involved in pressing for transparency; monitoring 
government-business relationships; monitoring public-sector reforms; and, at the 
same time, NGOs should be transparent themselves. Governments should agree to 
create transparency in their relationships with business, requiring disclosure 
of taxes, royalties and fees; have export credit and investment guarantee 
agencies require transparency; and reduce the discretionary powers of the 
central governments. The multilateral agencies should place transparency on 
their agendas for governments, be transparent about their own lending practices, 
and de-bar corrupt enterprises from their programs. Transnational corporations 
should commit to public disclosure of information that is not subject to 
confidentiality clauses; work with stakeholders to reduce opacity in contracts; 
develop transparency codes and standards; and work with civil society and 
government to build incentives for efficient and effective anti-corruption 
initiatives.</P>
<P>The discussion raised the concern that the report and recommendations did not 
make an explicit link between the lack of transparency and conflict. 
Participants agreed that the current conjuncture provides a favorable 
environment for advancing transparency as a means of conflict prevention. They 
pointed to the recent SG report on conflict prevention highlighting corruption, 
and the NEPAD attempt to develop African guidelines on governance issues; the 
initiative by Transparency International and Social Accountability International 
(SAI) to jointly develop Voluntary Principles based on the OECD Convention; the 
development of the Global Reporting Initiative; the IMF guidelines on fiscal 
transparency; and the BP commitment to publicly report its payments to the 
Angolan government. Barriers to good transparency practice identified by 
participants include bank secrecy laws, confidentiality clauses in contracts, 
and specific types of attorney-client privileges. A broad policy platform to 
advance transparency was presented by Transparency International as a result of 
the discussion of this working group. This platform provides an inspirational 
basis to make transparency an integral part of Global Compact activities.</P>
<P><STRONG>Next steps:</STRONG> This group will continue to explore ways and 
means to support the ongoing process for increased transparency at the sectoral 
levels such as efforts in the mining and petroleum-industry sectors, 
multilateral development bank efforts on good governance, and the World Bank's 
review of the natural-resource industry. The issue of transparency will be 
raised at the next G8 meeting in June, and the group will consider any actions 
that may ensue. In general this group recommended the need to support the 
development of indicators and metrics for transparency, the development of both 
market and government incentives for transparency, guidelines about data 
integrity and collection, and the training of managers and government 
policymakers in good practice. </P>
<H3>The Working Group on Multistakeholder Partnerships</H3>
<P>The report of this Working Group described five multi-stakeholder 
partnerships submitted by members of the UN Global Compact. Each case 
demonstrates the value of such partnerships for conflict prevention and 
management and post-conflict reconstruction. These cases included a range of 
different partners and different structures for achieving their goals. The five 
cases are: the US-UK Voluntary Principles on Human Rights and Security regarding 
the use of public and private security forces in unstable societies; the 
partnership initiated by International Alert with major oil companies in 
Azerbaijan; the War Torn Societies project for reconstruction in Somaliland; the 
Counteract Program of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Northern Ireland 
addressing workplace issues; and the Mines to Vines Croatia landmine removal and 
re-development project of Roots of Peace. These cases show that the process of 
developing a partnership is itself important, and that this process is 
facilitated by participant-driven analysis and information gathering. The issues 
need to be framed in a way that resonates with current and potential partners to 
facilitate dialogue and support. Committed leadership by individuals or a core 
group, and the vision to sustain the process, can be critical to success. </P>
<P>The discussion pointed out other sources of information, such as UNCTAD, the 
World Resources Institute, and the World Bank Business Partners for Development, 
and recent initiatives in Sri Lanka and Nigeria. The University of Michigan 
School of Business might be interested in supporting research on 
multistakeholder partnerships, as would the Carlson School or the Kennedy 
School. The cases provide a model for others to follow, as in the expansion of 
Mines to Vines to other regions and other agricultural products, including 
Afghanistan and potentially Angola. The US-UK Voluntary Principles may be 
expanded beyond the original participants. </P>
<P><STRONG>Next steps:</STRONG> This Group recommended that the cases be widely 
disseminated, in order to promote the idea of partnerships as a tool of conflict 
prevention, management and reconstruction. The group suggested publishing the 
cases to the web portal and using them in the Learning Forum. In addition, the 
cases should be re-formatted into summaries which can be distributed at upcoming 
events, placed in industry and venture philanthropy newsletters and in the 
media, and distributed via the UN system. The cases could be provided to 
business schools and public policy schools, and the authors should be encouraged 
to write them up as articles for publication in journals. The group also 
recommended that we develop deeper analysis to provide solid recommendations 
focusing on what conditions the partnership strategy is most useful, and how to 
implement such a strategy. This requires developing more cases, either submitted 
by UNGC members or drawn from the literature. The analysis should identify 
different types of partnership, from simple alignment of interests to joint 
delivery of services and pooling of resources. The analysis should also define 
the relevant stakeholders and their roles. It should clarify the different 
stages, levels, and types of conflict and how these influence which partnerships 
do or do not work. This could build on the work of International Alert, which is 
doing a survey of the literature on partnerships, and on the work of Amnesty 
International, which has mapped conflict around the world. The UNGC should 
convene a group of experts to examine the cases and develop guidelines on how 
and when to poursue a partnership strategy.</P>
