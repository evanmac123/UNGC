<H3>"The Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument or code of conduct, but a 
value-based platform designed to promote institutional learning. It utilizes the 
power of transparency and dialogue to identify and disseminate good practices 
based on universal principles." <BR></H3>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>During the past decade the forces of political transformation and economic 
globalization have created a world of new opportunities and hope for some, but 
increased instability and insecurity for others. As we enter the 21st Century 
violent conflict continues to affect the lives of millions of people, 
undermining human progress and economic development. This has important 
implications for the private sector, which has become an influential player in 
many conflict-prone or conflict-ridden countries. From Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe, 
the potential and reality of violent conflict is becoming an unavoidable 
business issue.</P>
<P>In the last decade of the 20th century private investment in the developing 
world increased dramatically. During the same period 'the number and magnitude 
of armed conflicts within and among states have lessened since the early 1990s 
by nearly half… Democratic governments now outnumber autocratic governments two 
to one and continue to be more successful than autocracies in resolving violent 
social conflicts'. Ted Robert Gurr, Monty G. Marshall and Deepa Khosla, Peace 
and Violent Conflicts 2000, Center for International Development and Conflict 
Management, University of Maryland, 2000 </P>
<P>There are many reasons for this remarkable, albeit very uneven, improvement 
in global security, not least the end of the Cold War, but globalization has 
also played an important role. Even during the Cold War era, global integration, 
trade and financial openness – the core elements of globalization - were 
positively associated with increased respect for core human rights. Wesley T. 
Milner, 'The Effects of Globalization and Liberalization', unpublished mss, 
2000. And one of the very few studies looking at the relationship between 
American corporate presence and respect for human rights in some fifty 
developing countries found that the relationship was consistently positive. 
William H. Meyer, 'Human Rights and MNCs', Human Rights Quarterly, 1996, p.368. 
A subsequently published critique of Meyer's paper in the same journal using 
different data sets found virtually no relationship. For an upbeat view of MNCs' 
contribution to human rights see, Deborah L. Spar, 'The Spotlight and the Bottom 
Line: How Multinationals Export Human Rights', Foreign Affairs, Vol. 77 No.2, 
p.1. </P>
<P>Yet the same decade of greatly increased investment by multinational 
corporations (MNCs) in the developing world and significant decreases in the 
overall level of global violence, also saw mounting criticism of MNC operations 
in zones of conflict. That criticism shows no signs of abating. The operations 
of Shell in Nigeria, Unocal in Burma, De Beers in Angola, Freeport in West 
Irian, Talisman in the Sudan and many others – have become the focus of intense, 
and often hostile, scrutiny.</P>
<P>While the two trends might seem contradictory, they are not. </P>
<P>Foreign direct investment (FDI) may well on balance spur economic and 
(subsequently) political liberalization, as proponents of globalization argue. 
This in turn may create propitious conditions for the emergence of democracy and 
reduced risks of violent conflict. Moreover, if MNC operations were indeed a 
contributory cause of violent conflict, as some critics of globalization assert, 
then we might expect those countries that have the highest level of foreign 
direct investment to have the highest levels of violence and repression – and 
vice versa. In fact the opposite is true. </P>
<P>The near-complete absence of foreign investment, as in the case of Cambodia 
under the Khmer Rouge, North Korea and contemporary Afghanistan, tends to be 
associated with economic decline, violent conflict and/or political repression. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, the region most seriously afflicted by abuses of human 
rights and civil war, also has the lowest FDI inflow of any developing country 
region. The OECD countries on the other hand, have both the highest levels of 
foreign direct investment in the world and the lowest levels of violent 
conflict.</P>
<P>It is clear nevertheless that, under certain circumstances, foreign direct 
investment, particularly in the timber, mineral or oil exploitation industries, 
may be a contributory cause of violent conflict, regardless of the intentions of 
the corporations concerned. </P>
<P>In Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and elsewhere, there is a very strong 
correlation between violent conflict, on the one hand, and disputes over the 
allocation of logging concessions and the distribution of logging company 
revenues, on the other. In Africa, as William Reno has pointed out, 'most states 
that currently experience major internal strife, or suffered such strife in the 
1990s, were dependent on exports of oil or another enclave mineral export for 
revenues.' William Reno, 'The Real (War) Economy of Angola', in Jakkie Cilliers 
and Christian Dietrich (eds), Angola's War Economy, Institute for Security 
Studies, Pretoria, 2000, p.223.</P>
<P>Wars have multiple causes and many of them have nothing to do with extractive 
industries, but the evidence strongly suggests that countries with weak 
governments that have a high degree of dependence on income from extractive 
industries are particularly prone to violent conflicts. </P>
<H3><BR>Why Some Industries Are More Likely To Be Associated With Conflict Than 
Others</H3>
<P>While major apparel and footwear companies like Gap and Nike have been 
targets of high-profile NGO campaigns, mostly regarding their labor practices, 
their operations have not been associated with widespread violent conflict, nor 
are they likely to be. </P>
<P>Mining and oil corporations have been less frequently targeted for their 
labor policies, primarily because their operations are highly capital-intensive. 
Their workforces are small and labor is a relatively small cost of the overall 
operation. Workers can therefore be paid considerably more than their 
equivalents in the apparel and footwear manufacturing industries at relatively 
little cost to the corporations concerned. Despite this the operations of 
companies in extractive industries in developing countries are more likely to be 
associated with violence than are those of service and manufacturing industries. 
There are several reasons for this.</P>
<P>In many poor countries where public servants, and sometimes politicians, are 
badly paid and transparency, oversight and accountability are minimal, the risk 
of corruption is very real. Where there is a prospect of tens, or even hundreds, 
of millions of dollars of government income being generated from extractive 
industry operations, the temptation to allocate mining licenses or logging 
concessions corruptly are correspondingly higher. As the World Bank's Paul 
Collier has noted, 'It is the feasibility of predation which determines the risk 
of conflict.' Cited in Reno, p.221. </P>
<P>If access to resources is allocated on the basis ethnic or other identity 
group criteria, creating or exacerbating 'horizontal inequality' in the process, 
the probability of protest and the risks of violence will increase. 'Horizontal 
inequality' is the consequence of unequal allocation of a variety of resources 
between groups. It is highly correlated with political violence in weak states. 
See Frances Stewart, 'The Root Causes of Humanitarian Emergencies' in E. Wayne 
Nafziger, Frances Stewart and Raimo Vayrynen (eds), War, Hunger and 
Displacement: the Origins of Humanitarian Emergencies, Oxford University Press, 
2000. In many - not all – cases, protest is met with repression, which 
frequently leads to counter-violence – and an upward spiral of death and 
destruction. </P>
<P>The logging industry in much of the developing world appears particularly 
prone to corruption and violence. The corrupt allocation of logging concessions 
and the inequitable distribution of resource rents, on the one hand, and 
conflicts between governments and criminal or rebel groups over control over 
resource exploitation, on the other, have been major contributory causes of the 
violent conflicts in Burma, Cambodia, Acheh, West Irian, Kalimantan, the 
Solomons, Fiji and Liberia. </P>
<P>The relationship between logging operations and violent conflict in many 
parts of the developing world has received relatively little attention in the 
North, in part because major Western corporations have not been involved, and in 
part because there have been relatively few high-profile NGO campaigns directed 
against them. An important exception has been the high-profile campaign waged by 
Global Witness against illegal logging in Cambodia.</P>
<P>The oil and mining industries have been also associated with violent protest 
in many parts of the world. With respect to oil, one analyst recently claimed 
that: 'From Nigeria and Venezuela to Indonesia and Algeria, riots, conflict and 
outright civil war threaten the populations of OPEC countries.' Terry Lynn Karl, 
'The Perils of the Petro-State', International Journal, Fall 1999. In the case 
of mining, a dispute over how revenues from Rio Tinto's giant Panguna copper 
mine in Bougaineville should have been distributed between the Papua New Guinea 
government and the people Bougaineville, led in 1989 to a bitter civil war that 
lasted through much of the 1990s and claimed an estimated 10,000 lives. While 
the Bougaineville case is perhaps the most extreme example of a dispute over 
mining operations causing violent conflict, it is by no means the only one.</P>
<P>In conflicts between the state and local communities over mining operations – 
like that in Bougaineville - the state and corporations are usually at an 
advantage. As a 1995 US State Department report noted:</P>
<P>Where indigenous people clash with development projects, the developers 
almost always win... Tensions with indigenous people in Irian Jaya, including 
the vicinity of the Freeport McMoRan mining concession near Timika, led to a 
crackdown by government security forces, resulting in the deaths of civilians 
and other violent human rights abuses. </P>
<P>This pattern – of government security forces using force to repress local 
protests against the operations of extractive industry corporations – is the 
commonest form of violence associated with the presence of these corporations in 
developing countries today. </P>
<P>Where there are pre-existing conflicts, as in Angola, Cambodia and elsewhere, 
revenue from oil, mining, or logging operations can sustain and exacerbate the 
violence. As a Global Witness report on Cambodia pointed out in 1997:</P>
<P>With the end of the Cold War, timber revenue began to replace foreign support 
for the warring factions in Cambodia's long running civil war. The timber trade 
funded the war and the war created more demand for timber, a vicious circle. 
Very quickly personal fortunes were being made by political and military leaders 
on both sides and the exploitation of timber became a cause for armed conflict 
in its own right.</P>
<P>Moreover, far from providing an economic bonanza, high-value extractive 
industries, frequently generate massive economic - and political - problems. 
This in turn can increase the risk of violent conflict. Corrupt politicians and 
officials may benefit; but society as a whole suffers. The phenomena is known as 
'the Dutch Disease' – a reference to the disastrous impact that reliance on 
North Sea oil had on the economy of the Netherlands:</P>
<P>"Dutch disease" is the diagnosis development economists give to an all too 
familiar set of symptoms: rapid capital inflows appreciate the exchange rate, 
erode the competitiveness of [non-resource] industries subject to international 
competition, promote current-account deficits, accelerate inflation, distort 
investment and link the economy to volatile commodity markets. </P>
<P>In politics, the corrupting effects of rentier economics perverts governance 
... </P>
<P>'Dutch Disease' gives rise to the 'paradox of plenty'. As Terry Lynn Karl has 
recently noted: </P>
<P>The pernicious access to easy money weakens traditional work ethics and 
reduces incentives for entrepreneurship, lowering financial discipline within 
bureaucracies and leading to reckless budgetary practices. Most importantly, it 
preempts efforts to mobilize domestic resources through taxation, reduces 
tolerance for austerity and produces a dangerous reliance upon the state for the 
resolution of all problems. </P>
<P>Angola is one of the most oil-dependent states in the world with around 80% 
of government revenue being derived from oil exports. Here 'Dutch Disease' has 
been particularly damaging. During the 1990s the well-being of citizens (as 
measured by the United Nations' Human Development Index) declined sharply as oil 
imports rose. </P>
<P>In 1997, the British oil giant BP commissioned a social impact assessment of 
its operations in Angola from Environmental Resource Management (ERM). The 
report noted that there was a '… widespread perception amongst non-experts and 
experts that little oil revenue is used for social and economic development. 
Various reasons are cited for this, predominantly military/security spending and 
corruption.' Cited in Global Witness, A Crude Awakening: The Role of the Oil and 
Banking Industries in Angola's Civil War and the Plunder of State Assets. . </P>
<P>In his survey of the 'paradox of plenty' in the OPEC states Karl found that: 
</P>
<P>….it is not surprising that approximately 65 to 75 percent of the post-1974 
GDP went toward public and private consumption--aimed first and foremost toward 
the key constituencies supporting the rulers of oil states. Much of this took 
place through subsidies to social groups, friends, family and political 
supporters of the government, and much through the awarding of contracts on what 
were most often non-market criteria.</P>
<P>It is precisely this sort of behavior that has generated such bitter popular 
resentment against governments that have succumbed to the 'Dutch Disease'.</P>
<P>The 'Dutch Disease' thesis places primary responsibility for the problems 
generated by reliance on extractive industries on governments, though it is 
important to note that there would be no 'Dutch Disease' without the rents that 
the corporations provide. Corporations certainly agree that governments are 
responsible for security and some corporate spokepersons make the case that, far 
from contributing to insecurity, their operations have security and human rights 
benefits. Thus Unocal argues that:</P>
<P>Our energy development operations have clear human rights implications. We 
generate economic growth that gives political confidence and influence to a 
rising middle class. We hire, train and provide advancement opportunities for 
the citizens of our host countries. We introduce modern values and concepts, 
such as equal employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, ethnic background 
or religious preference. We provide a supportive working environment in which 
all employees may freely contribute. We introduce safety training and 
environmental programs into the workplace, and offer health care and educational 
opportunities that further empower communities. And, in keeping with our 
commitment to improve people's lives wherever we work, we support a wide variety 
of humanitarian and philanthropic initiatives.</P>
<P>It is, of course, possible for all of these benefits to be created while at 
the same time corporate revenues, irrespective of the wishes of the corporation, 
sustain a regime's corrupt and repressive practices. </P>
<P>Mining and logging operations, unlike manufacturing and services, frequently 
displace people physically and threaten indigenous cultures, sacred sites and 
livelihoods. This too can be a cause of grievance and conflict. Extractive 
industries can also cause serious environmental damage that can have major 
economic, and sometimes political, consequences. Inappropriate logging 
operations can cause massive soil erosion, siltation of aquatic ecosystems and 
coral reefs and greatly increase the risk – and cost - of flooding. Mining 
operations can pollute, and in some cases poison rivers, causing serious damage 
to the livelihoods of local communities and stirring deep resentments. </P>
<P>Neither manufacturing nor service industries are associated with 'Dutch 
Disease' phenomena, nor do they normally generate the sort of environmental 
degradation associated with large-scale mining or inappropriate logging 
operations. These businesses rarely have a role in causing conflict, but they 
can play an important role in building prosperity, which in turn can be an 
important antidote to conflict. </P>
<P>Extractive industry corporations have a particular interest in reducing the 
risk of violent conflict. Their investments tend to be large, their time 
horizons long and their plant and equipment susceptible to sabotage. </P>
<H3><BR>Dilemmas Confronting Corporations Operating in Zones of Conflict</H3>
<P>In our discussions with multinational corporations, we have found that most 
companies have common goals: they want to invest in countries which respect the 
rule of law, which guarantee equality before law, which have transparent laws, 
which believe in good governance, which seek to improve the lot of their people, 
and which respect the human rights of the population. Yet, that collective goal 
disintegrates at individual levels in some cases. When we ask why, the companies 
say this is because all companies will not act in concert. A French company will 
say, if we don't do it somebody else will. An American company will say if we 
don't play along the Europeans will. <BR>Pierre Sane, Secretary-General, Amnesty 
International Pierre Sane, 'Why Human Rights Should Matter to the Business 
World', Earth Times News, January 8, 2001.</P>
<P>Even the sternest critics of MNC operations in zones of conflict accept that 
the corporations concerned confront a number of extremely difficult 
dilemmas:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>If they increase their costs by voluntarily pursuing policies designed to 
  enhance respect for human rights and societal security, they may put 
  themselves at a competitive disadvantage relative to less scrupulous 
  competitors who refuse to contribute, but who still 'free ride' on any 
  security benefits that are forthcoming. But if they fail to act they risk 
  being attacked by NGOs for lack of concern for human rights and thus incurring 
  reputational costs. </LI>
  <LI>If they seek to pressure governments into adopting greater transparency 
  and accountability, or showing greater concern for human rights, they may put 
  themselves at a political – and thus economic - disadvantage relative to those 
  who adopt the traditional business ethic of non-intervention in the affairs of 
  governments in whose country they operate. But doing nothing risks being 
  accused of complicity with human rights abuses and worse.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>If they seek to promote positive change by raising human rights issues 
  with governments privately, they may be accused of doing nothing by outside 
  critics. But raising such issues publicly risks being rebuffed by officialdom 
  and accused of unwarranted interference in the affairs of a sovereign 
  government.</LI>
  <LI>If they refuse official pressures to act corruptly, as OECD regulations 
  require, they risk losing business to less scrupulous competitors. But if they 
  seek to protect their interests by acceding to such demands they risking being 
  attacked for complicity with corruption.</LI>
  <LI>If they seek to compensate local communities for any environmental damage 
  or loss of amenity caused by their operations, they can rarely be certain that 
  the compensation will in fact reach those for whom it is intended, creating 
  great resentment. But failure to offer compensation is equally certain to 
  generate resentment.</LI>
  <LI>If corporations rely on governments to provide security they risk being 
  blamed if government security forces unwarranted force to repress peaceful 
  protests against their operations. This has been the commonest cause of 
  violence associated with corporate operations and has prompted a number of 
  corporations to review the whole issue of corporate security.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>If they employ private security organizations they risk being blamed for 
  any inappropriate behavior by members of those organization – a major problem 
  for many corporations in the past. Yet if they fail to make appropriate 
  security arrangements, they put both their operations and staff at risk. These 
  and other concerns led, at the end of last year, to a set of principles on 
  security and human rights being drawn up by an influential group of human 
  rights NGOs, major extractive industry corporations and the British and 
  American governments (see below).</LI>
  <LI>One of the most sensitive issues confronting corporations in zones of 
  conflict is the distribution of income derived from MNC operations between 
  central governments and the communities in which the MNC operations actually 
  take place. Too often the latter's needs and interests have been minimized or 
  ignored. It was disputes over this issue that led to the war in 
  Bougaineville.</LI></UL>
<H3>The Issue of Complicity </H3>
<P>Where they are mined responsibly, as in Botswana, South Africa or Namibia, 
diamonds can contribute to development and stability. But where governments 
are<BR>corrupt, rebels are pitiless and borders are porous, as in Angola, Congo 
or Sierra Leone, the glittering stones have become agents of slave labor, murder 
and wholesale economic collapse. 'To Some Countries, Gems Bring Only Misery, The 
International Herald Tribune, April 7, 2000.</P>
<P>The Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict noted in 1997 that, 'It 
cannot be emphasized enough that governments bear the greatest responsibility to 
prevent deadly conflict'. Few would dispute this – including those human rights 
NGOs most critical of the activities of corporations operating in zones of 
conflict. Moreover the fact that the operations of extractive industry 
corporations are often associated with violent conflicts is not to say that they 
cause them. </P>
<P>But while corporate spokespersons have traditionally argued that they cannot 
be held responsible for the actions of sovereign foreign governments, this view 
is increasingly being challenged, as is the frequently expressed view that the 
private sector lacks the ability to influence host governments. As British 
Petroleum's CEO, John Browne argued in 1997, '… to say that companies have no 
power would be as much of a caricature as saying they are all powerful'. Speech 
to Council on Foreign Relations, 1997. Governments bear primary responsibility 
for security, but this does not mean that corporations bear none.</P>
<P>Critics argue that where corporate taxes and royalties play a critical role 
in sustaining repressive governments they cannot avoid charges of complicity 
with the abuses of human rights that such governments perpetrate. Avoidance of 
complicity with human rights violations is, of course, one of the core 
principles of the Global Compact. There is however little consensus on how 
complicity should be defined. </P>
<P>The extent to which the private sector has a vital commercial interest in the 
contested issue of human rights was made clear in a recent survey carried out by 
the Ashbridge Centre for Business and Society. The survey found that:</P>
<P>… human rights issues have caused 36% of the biggest 500 companies to abandon 
a proposed investment project and 19% to disinvest from a country.<BR>Cited in 
'Business and Human Rights: an Update', United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, July 2000. </P>
<P>Many corporations have adopted codes of conduct or social responsibility 
policies in response to growing criticism, but as the United Nations Development 
Programme's 2000 Human Development Report noted, many of these 'fail to meet 
human rights standards, or lack implementation measures and independent audits.' 
Cited in Ibid. The Ashbridge Centre report found that only 44% of corporate 
codes of conduct made explicit reference to human rights. </P>
<H3><BR>Responses of International Institutions</H3>
<P>International institutions have been pursuing the issue of human rights and 
the private sector in a number of ways: </P>
<P>The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has expanded its 
dialogue with the private sector and the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights has been reviewing a report on 'draft principles 
relating to human rights conduct of companies'. Ibid. <BR>The World Bank's 
three-member Inspection Panel has been described as a 'precedent-setting public 
accountability mechanism'. It adjudicates complaints from individuals regarding 
harms allegedly done to them by Bank-funded projects. The Bank is the only 
international institution that permits such direct representations by individual 
citizens. Many complaints have related to human rights violations associated 
with major infrastructure projects. While the Bank has no mandate to address 
conflict issues, many of its activities are intended to create the conditions 
under which the risk of armed conflict diminishes. <BR>The OECD adopted its 
'Revised Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises' in June last year. The 
Guidelines are voluntary and, among other things, call on enterprises to respect 
'the human rights of those affected by their activities consistent with the host 
government's international obligations and commitments'. </P>
<H3>NGO Responses</H3>
<P>… the question of investment disinvestments in countries with repressive 
regimes is one of the most contentious of all questions of social 
responsibility.<BR>Peter Schwartz and Blair Gibb, When Good Companies Do Bad 
Things, cited in Nelson, The Business of Peace Op. Cit.</P>
<P>Some NGO campaigns call for corporations to withdraw investments from 
countries whose regimes have odious human rights records – the disinvestment 
campaign against South Africa, is the best-known example. </P>
<P>The Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, for example, calls on 
companies to 'withdraw from a country in instances where there are gross and 
systematic violations of human rights and where there is a recognized movement 
from within the country calling for withdrawal.' </P>
<P>Disinvestment strategies are predicated on the assumption that the threat or 
reality of corporate withdrawal will pressure the target regime into improving 
its human rights regime. The current NGO campaign to pressure corporations 
operating in Burma to withdraw has had a considerable impact with four major US 
oil companies deciding to withdraw, but whether corporate withdrawal will 
generate the desired political changes in Burma remains to be seen. What is 
clear is that withdrawal will cost the jobs of many ordinary citizens. </P>
<P>Disinvestment campaigns will clearly not succeed if other less scrupulous 
corporations simply move in to replace those that withdraw. Indeed such a result 
could well worsen the very conditions the led to demands for disinvestment in 
the first place. But if a target regime believes that a disinvestment campaign 
will succeed – i.e. that there will be a major withdrawal of foreign investment 
and the consequent loss of the income such investment generates – then this may 
be useful instrument of suasion. Many analysts believe that the disinvestment 
campaign directed against the apartheid regime in South Africa was an important 
element in its subsequent demise.</P>
<P>An important caveat is necessary here. Disinvestment campaigns are a form of 
private economic sanction and the track record of sanctions as a coercive 
instrument for changing state behavior is poor – and is poorest against 
authoritarian states. Andrew Mack, 'The Efficacy of UN Sanctions', Security 
Dialogue, 31(2), September, 2000, with Asif Khan. IMF and World Bank 
'conditionality' strategies – which also seek to use economic leverage to change 
the behavior of target states - do not have a very impressive track record 
either. Devesh Kapur and Richard Webb, 'Governance-Related Conditionalities of 
the International Financial Institutions, G-24 Discussion Paper, No. 6 August 
2000. The World Bank's Paul Collier has argued that, not only are conditionality 
policies relatively ineffective, but that they imply a deeply resented transfer 
of sovereignty '… which is not only unprecedented but is often dysfunctional.' 
Cited in Ibid. p.8.</P>
<P>Concern about the effectiveness of the coercive use of economic instruments 
has led Collier and others to argue in favor of 'positive conditionality' i.e. a 
policy of rewarding good behaviour rather than punishing bad. Cited in Ibid. 
p.15. Global Witness also champions positive conditionality. The sanctions 
literature provides some support for this approach, but suggests that a careful 
mix of positive and negative incentives is more effective than either approach 
on its own. See Gitty M. Armani, 'A Larger Role for Positive Sanctions in Cases 
of Compellence?', Working Paper No. 12, Center for International Relations, 
University of California, Santa Barbara, May 1997. The most complete recent 
study on positive inducements is, David Cortright, ed., The Price of Peace: 
Incentives and International Conflict Prevention, Rowan and Littlefield, Lanham, 
1997.</P>
<P>Disinvestment is eschewed by mainstream NGOs like Amnesty International, 
Human Rights Watch and International Alert in favor a strategy of critical 
engagement with corporations. The campaign for greater corporate (and 
governmental) transparency and accountability being waged by Global Witness, 
International Alert and Human Rights Watch in Angola is a case in point. Some 
oil companies have been responsive to this campaign; others have not.</P>
<H3>Voluntary Agreements Versus Regulation</H3>
<P>The underpinnings of both a profitable business environment and a salutary 
human rights environment rest on the same core foundations: rule of law and good 
governance. Harold Honju Koh, Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights 
and Labor, U.S Department of State, Briefing December 20, 2000</P>
<P>Traditionally corporations recognized obligations to their shareholders, to 
their employees and to obey the law of the countries in which they operated. 
Over the past decade, a much broader conception of stakeholders has evolved, one 
that includes all constituencies that are affected (favorably or otherwise) by 
corporate operations. It includes consumers, members of the communities in which 
corporations operate, NGOs, company suppliers and competitors, governments and 
oppositions. In the case of Global Compact companies it also includes the United 
Nations. </P>
<P>The emergence of multi-stakeholders has complicated life for corporations, 
often in challenging and frustrating ways. On the positive side 
multi-stakeholders can sometimes cooperate to create voluntary agreements to 
resolve issues that no single actor, certainly not a corporation, could resolve 
on its own. As a recent Fund for Peace publication puts it:</P>
<P>Creative partnerships that promote human rights, support civil society, and 
address corporate needs create a win-win-win situation for governments, civil 
society and the private sector.</P>
<P>Proponents of voluntary agreements also argue that they produce outcomes with 
a greater sense of ownership and commitment than does regulation, while also 
providing sources of expertise and innovation. But such agreements are also 
criticized as being little more than exercises in corporate public relations and 
a diversion from the real task of creating verifiable and legally enforceable 
regulatory frameworks. </P>
<P>Major NGOs like Human Rights Watch argue that regulation is in the interest 
of the private sector since requiring all companies to meet the same standards 
of corporate responsibility will create a level playing field that will impose 
costs equally and eliminate both the advantages that unscrupulous corporations 
currently enjoy, and the free rider problem. However, effectively monitoring and 
enforcing regulatory frameworks in weak states may be difficult, if not 
impossible. </P>
<P>This does not mean that regulation is irrelevant – it already operates at a 
number of different levels. States have long been under legally binding 
obligations to respect international human rights and humanitarian law. Moreover 
there have been an increasing number of instances where companies have been 
taken to court in their countries of origin for alleged violations of 
international law that have taken place in their operations abroad. While the 
right to bring such cases remains legally contentious, '…the idea that claims 
can be litigated away from the country where the harm occurred is certain to 
open up new challenges for businesses operating on the world stage.' 'Business 
and Human Rights' Op. Cit.</P>
<P>In November 1997, OECD member states adopted the Convention on Combating 
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The 
convention is legally binding and is an example of how regulation can enhance 
the interests of the private sector as a whole by helping create a level playing 
field. As World Bank President Jim Wolfensohn has put it, 'To meet the challenge 
[of corruption] we must set the policy environment right and create an 
environment of transparency and accountability. <A 
href="http://www.worldbank.org">www.worldbank.org</A></P>
<P>Eventually what are now voluntary codes may become part of national 
legislation or international treaties. In the meantime, at least with respect to 
codes of conduct, corporations can go beyond self-monitoring and agree to 
independent monitoring of their corporate responsibility commitments by 
independent non-governmental institutions including commercial auditing 
companies. Some companies already do this. </P>
<P>The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has gone further 
and suggested that the a task force comprising businesses, trade unions and 
national and international NGOs be created to explore ways of creating a 
credible independent monitoring mechanism to ensure that the commitments of the 
private sector are being met. Ibid. </P>
<P>Cambodia's recent history provides an unprecedented example of an independent 
NGO being tasked by donor states and international institutions to monitor an 
agreement directly relevant to conflict prevention. Conflict over logging had 
fueled violence in Cambodia for over a decade, yet the issue was not really 
understood by the donor community until Global Witness's extraordinary 
revelations about illegal logging achieved widespread international concern. 70% 
of Cambodia's forests have been logged out using unsustainable logging practices 
and, according to some estimates, the remaining stands of timber will have gone 
by 2003. </P>
<P>A meeting of major donors in February 1999 determined that independent 
monitoring was essential to ensure corporate and Cambodian government's 
compliance with the promised forestry reforms. Global Witness was appointed to 
this official independent monitoring role and its work has been funded by donor 
states. </P>
<P>While independent monitoring has made many improvements, illegal logging 
still continues on a large scale. Moreover there has been relatively little 
engagement with the Asian logging companies that operate in Cambodia and most 
other Southeast Asian and South Pacific forests – certainly nothing approaching 
the sort of dialogue that has taken place between major Northern MNCs and 
leading human rights NGOs. </P>
<H3>Multi-actor Voluntary Guidelines</H3>
<P>In addition to the nine principles of the Global Compact itself, there have 
been a number of other multi-actor efforts to produce broad principles that 
could guide corporate conduct in zones of conflict. Each stresses the importance 
of multi-stakeholder dialogue. They include:</P>
<H4>1. The Business of Peace' Five Principles </H4>
<P>These provide detailed guidelines for corporations operating in zones of 
conflict. The guidelines include:</P>
<P>strategic commitment - CEO and board level leadership on corporate 
responsibility issues; <BR>risk and impact analysis - which might involve the 
creation of conflict impact statements; <BR>dialogue and consultation – 
encompassing a broad range of stakeholders; <BR>partnership and collective 
action - including multi-stakeholder cooperation to achieve what corporations 
cannot achieve acting alone; <BR>evaluation and accountability of the 
implementation of the principles, which may include independent verification and 
public dissemination. <BR>The Business of Peace was produced by three NGOs, 
International Alert, the Council on Economic Priorities and the Prince of Wales 
Business Leaders Forum. </P>
<H4>2. The Fund For Peace 'Human Rights and Business Roundtable'</H4>
<P>The US-based Human Rights and Business Roundtable, established by the Fund 
for Peace in January 1998, seeks to engage members of the corporate and human 
rights communities in constructive dialogue to find common ground on issues that 
divide them. </P>
<P>The aims of the Roundtable are:</P>
<P>To emphasize cooperation over confrontation; <BR>To promote dialogue, 
relationship-building and conflict resolution among the corporate and human 
rights community representatives; <BR>To encourage consultation between the 
corporate and human rights communities on ways to advance the rule of law and 
promote open societies. </P>
<H4>3. The Inter-Faith Center on Corporate Responsibility's, 'Principles for 
Global Corporate Responsibility: Benchmarks for Measuring Business Performance 
(Global Principles)' </H4>
<P>The ICCR describes its Global Principles as 'an accountability tool that is 
useful for socially responsible investors, grass-roots activists, 
nongovernmental organizations and for corporations to apply the comprehensive 
set of principles, criteria and bench marks to their global operations.'</P>
<H4><BR>4. The United States and Great Britain Voluntary Principles on Security 
and Human Rights </H4>
<P>This agreement, signed in December 2000, is unique in that it deals with 
highly specific principles intended to enhance the security of the operations of 
extractive industries in the developing world. It is also unique in that its 
signatories include some of the mainstream NGOs that have been most critical of 
extractive industry corporations and some of the major corporations that had 
been the target of the NGO critiques and two major donor states, Britain and the 
United States. </P>
<P>The principles are limited to issues relating to the safety and security of 
corporate operations in risk-prone areas, but are detailed and highly specific. 
</P>
<H4><BR>5. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises </H4>
<P>What differentiates OECD guidelines from other voluntary guidelines for 
corporate behavior is that they have been adopted by governments, not simply by 
NGOs and companies. The 30 Member countries of the OECD plus Argentina, Brazil 
and Chile signed the guidelines in June 2000. They contain detailed 
recommendations on appropriate corporate responses to the issues of corruption 
and human rights.</P>
<H3><BR>The Chad-Cameroun Pipeline Agreement</H3>
<P>The Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project [is] an 
unprecedented framework to transform oil wealth into direct benefits for the 
poor, the vulnerable and the environment. In addition to the financing, the 
package of support includes a first-of-its-kind program to direct new revenues 
to support economic and social development programs in Chad, which is one of the 
world's poorest countries.<BR>World Bank Press Release June 6</P>
<P>At the beginning of this paper it was argued that the corrupt and inequitable 
disbursement of corporate taxes and royalties was a major driver of violence in 
the conflicts that have wracked so many resource-rich developing countries. The 
combination of very large resource rents and lack of transparency, militates 
against accountability and creates tempting opportunities for illicit personal 
gain. The extraordinary Chad-Cameroun pipeline agreement signed in June last 
year is based on an ingenious model that provides an in-principle solution to 
this persistent problem. </P>
<P>NGOs had long opposed to the exploitation of Chad's huge oil reserves and the 
transportation of the oil via pipeline through Cameroun to the coast. They were 
concerned that the flood of oil revenues would increase official corruption and 
sustain and strengthen a government with a much-criticized human rights record, 
while also causing considerable harm to a fragile environment. </P>
<P>A coalition of NGOs raised these issues persistently and effectively with the 
World Bank whose participation was a necessary condition for the $3.7 billion 
project to go ahead. The consortium of oil corporations was anxious to exploit 
Chad's oil reserves, but the companies were not willing invest without Bank 
participation. The Bank, however, was sympathetic to many of the NGOs concerns. 
Over several years of intense negotiation a deal was evolved that should in 
principle provide a win-win solution for all parties. </P>
<P>Under the terms of the agreement the government of Chad has agreed that most 
of the oil revenues should be targeted to poverty reduction and that there 
should be independent public oversight of the use of these resources - both 
unprecedented moves in a major resource project of this type. </P>
<P>Under the terms of the agreement, 10% of the oil royalties and revenues will 
be held in trust for future generations (following a precedent set by Norway), 
80% of the remaining funds will be devoted to education, health and social 
services, rural development, infrastructure, and environmental and water 
resource management. 5% will be earmarked for regional development in the 
oil-producing area. The latter provision should prevent the sort of resentments 
over revenue-sharing that were a major cause of the war in Bougaineville. </P>
<P>There will be annual published audits of the petroleum accounts, regular 
public expenditure reviews by the Government and the Bank, and special 
arrangements for channeling and accounting for the funds. For details of the 
project see: <A href="http://www.worldbank.org">www.worldbank.org</A>. This too 
is unique. </P>
<P>Perhaps most important, and indicative of the extraordinary lengths that the 
Bank, the government of Chad and its partners have gone to prevent an emergence 
of the 'Dutch Disease' pathologies that have blighted so many other 
resource-dependent economies in the developing world, is the creation of a 
distinguished six-person independent International Advisory Group (IAG). The IAG 
will play a critical role in monitoring compliance with the agreement. </P>
<P>It remains to be seen whether this radical and creative agreement will work 
as planned – the fact that the Chad government recently spent $4.5 million of 
its oil revenues to buy arms has angered Bank officials and raised questions 
about its commitment to the agreement.</P>
<P>But with literally hundreds of oil and other mineral projects being 
contemplated in the developing world the Chad-Cameroun pipeline model offers the 
prospect of reducing, if not eliminating, the problems arising from lack of 
transparency, accountability, corruption, inequitable distribution of extractive 
industry revenues and violent conflict that have beset so many resource projects 
in the past.</P>
<P>The model does not, of course, offer a solution to countries already in the 
grip of 'Dutch Disease'. In these cases NGOs, the Bank and the IMF are pressing 
governments to be more transparent about the disbursement of oil and other 
mineral revenues. Transparency is a necessary condition for accountability and 
an important check against corruption. In Angola, a number of oil corporations 
are now providing details of their payments to the government – a move long 
demanded by NGOs.</P>
<P>As Devesh Kapur and Richard Webb argued in a recent paper:</P>
<P>Transparency is one area in which the [World Bank and IMF] could bring about 
a major reform with powerful democratizing potential. Information is 
empowerment… Kapur and Webb, Op. Cit., p.18 </P>
<H3>Corporations and Political Risk Insurance </H3>
<P>The international insurance industry has a potentially useful, but largely 
unrealized, role to play in conflict prevention. Taking out Political Risk 
Insurance is a standard policy for corporations operating in risk-prone 
countries. Corporations also seek the involvement the multilateral development 
organizations, such as the World Bank, the IMF and the regional development 
banks, which is seen as a form of informal insurance. The World Bank's 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) also provides political risk 
insurance – particularly for the least-developed countries. MIGA requires that 
the projects it insures be financially, economically, and environmentally sound. 
There seems to be little reason in principle why the financial and economic 
soundness of a project should not include stringent transparency and 
accountability provisions that would help reduce opportunities for corruption 
and the political instability risks that corruption so often generates. </P>
<P>In December last year, the OECD announced that an action program to deter 
bribery in government-supported export credit transactions had been agreed to. 
The export credit and export credit insurance agencies of OECD countries will 
now demand written statements from all companies applying for coverage, stating 
they have not, and will not, engage in bribery. If bribery is established, the 
agency will deny coverage or reject claims for indemnification and will refer 
the case to the judicial authorities. </P>
<H3>Financial Institutions</H3>
<P>NGOs are already bringing pressure to bear on financial institutions that are 
perceived to be supporting corporations accused of human rights violations, or 
of propping up repressive regimes. 'Ethical' mutual funds are highly vulnerable 
to this sort of pressure. This is essentially an indirect disinvestment strategy 
and confronts the same problems as other disinvestment strategies.</P>
<P>But financial institutions, particularly banks, could also play a potentially 
valuable role in reducing corruption, illicit gem mining and illicit small arms 
transfers, and other activities directly related to conflict, if they were to 
collaborate with authorities and to track the money flows that associated these 
illicit activities. Until recently neither banks nor governments had shown much 
enthusiasm for going down this track. In October last year, however, a group of 
the world's largest banks agreed to a set of global anti-money laundering 
guidelines for international private banks. The signatories included 11 major 
international banks and Transparency International (TI), the global 
anti-corruption organization.</P>
<H3><BR>Other Conflict Prevention and Post-Conflict Reconstruction Measures That 
Corporations Might Consider</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>The donation of funds and/or expertise and equipment to NGOs and 
  international agencies working in the realms of conflict prevention, 
  humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction.</LI>
  <LI>The extension of the UK/USA Principles on Human Rights and Security to 
  encompass more countries, more companies and more industries.</LI>
  <LI>The exercise of corporate influence, either individually or through 
  business associations, to pressure donor governments to support conflict 
  prevention efforts both nationally, and through international organizations 
  like the United Nations.</LI>
  <LI>Active support, not just of conflict prevention efforts, but also the 
  related work of humanitarian and human rights organizations.</LI>
  <LI>The production, sometimes in collaboration with NGOs and international 
  institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank, of Conflict Impact 
  Statements, which could build on and amplify existing social and environmental 
  impact statements and provide a specialized form of political risk assessment. 
  </LI></UL>
<H3><BR>Conclusion</H3>
<P>While there are inevitably major areas of disagreement with respect to human 
rights and conflict prevention issues between the NGO and corporate members of 
the Global Compact, there is also a rich menu of choices for cooperation and 
even collaboration. The emergence of multi-stakeholders, particularly in the 
poorest countries where governance capacity is least and the risk of conflict 
greatest, creates many possibilities for collective action solutions to problems 
that neither corporations, nor governments, nor NGOs can resolve on their own.
