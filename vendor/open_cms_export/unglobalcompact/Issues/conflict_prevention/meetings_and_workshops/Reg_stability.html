<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The human rights responsibilities of multinational corporations – 
particularly companies operating in unstable areas of the world -- are 
increasingly the subject of media attention and Non-Governmental Organization 
campaigns. Human Rights Watch's World Report 2000 noted recently, while progress 
had been made in increasing corporate attention to human rights more needed to 
be done.</P>
<P>The recognition that business and human rights were inextricably intertwined 
continued to grow throughout the year and moved beyond a simple debate over the 
need to adopt codes of conduct. Those companies that previously stated a 
commitment to human rights continued to develop programs to implement their 
policies. Human Rights Watch, World Report 2000 (December 2000). Reports of the 
Corporations and Human Rights division of Human Rights Watch (<A 
href="http://www.hrw.org">www.hrw.org</A>) include: "Human Rights Concerns 
Raised by the Security Arrangements of Transnational Oil Companies" (1998); 
"Crackdown in the Niger Delta" (1999); "Update: Recent Human Rights Violations 
In Nigeria's Oil Producing Region"; "The Price Of Oil: Corporate Responsibility 
and Human Rights Violations in Nigeria's Oil Producing Communities" (1999); and 
"The Enron Corporation: Corporate Complicity in Human Rights 
Violations"(1999).</P>
<P>The Economist recently described the risks faced by companies operating in 
conflict zones: </P>
<P>Pipelines can be blown up by terrorists. Contracts can be torn up by crooked 
partners. Fragile economies can collapse. And in recent years, firms doing 
business in countries with unpleasant governments have been pilloried by 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), endangering the most priceless of assets, 
their good name. "Business in Difficult Places: Risky Returns," The Economist, 
May 20, 2000.</P>
<P>The first section of this paper gives a brief overview of some well-known 
cases in which the media and NGOs have criticized business for its activities in 
zones of conflict. The second section reviews examples of initiatives that 
companies have undertaken in cooperation with governments, civil society or the 
UN.</P>
<H3>I - Business in Zones Conflict: Recent Cases</H3>
<H4>1. Extractive and Energy Sectors </H4>
<P>In 1994, Royal Dutch/Shell, came under international scrutiny by human rights 
groups and the press when the Nigerian Government executed Ken Saro Wiwa and 
eight other Ogoni Tribe members for protesting Shell's environmental policies. 
At the time, a Shell spokesperson declined any public comment, on the ground 
that the action of the Nigerian Government in executing the Ogoni 9 was "not an 
appropriate subject for private companies…to comment on." Following intense 
media and NGO criticism, Shell began to work with Amnesty International's United 
Kingdom Business Group on its human rights policies. Amnesty has published 
"Human Rights, Is It Any of Your Business?" intended as a primer for 
international businesses to examine their new responsibilities in the global 
economy.</P>
<P>Another extractive industry company targeted by NGO and media campaigns is 
Freeport- McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. The company runs a large gold and 
copper mining operation on the Indonesian island of Irian Jaya (West Papua). The 
area is environmentally sensitive, culturally diverse and one of the most 
politically unstable parts of Indonesia. Freeport came under criticism primarily 
because of serious abuses by Indonesian security forces perceived to be acting 
on its behalf. These abuses led to local rioting, civil lawsuits by the 
indigenous Amungme Tribal Council, and a series of campaigns targeting the 
company by leading NGOs. </P>
<P>Freeport's Chairman, Jim Bob Moffet, reportedly learned first hand about the 
human rights abuses of the Indonesian Government's security forces during his 
first visit to Irian Jaya. The visit followed demonstrations by university 
students outside his New Orleans home. Following Moffet's visit, the company 
began its own internal evaluation of its human rights performance. In January 
2000, Freeport engaged Gabrielle Kirk McDonald as special counsel on human 
rights. Ms. McDonald is a prominent American civil rights lawyer and former 
Federal judge who had just stepped down from her post as judge of the 
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Freeport also joined the 
'Global Mining Initiative', which seeks to assess "the environmental impacts of 
extraction, and impacts on communities, indigenous peoples and human rights". 
See <A href="http://www.globalmining.com">www.globalmining.com</A> for more 
information on this initiative. Freeport adopted an Environmental Policy and a 
Social and Human Rights Policy that was developed in consultation with the RFK 
Center on Human Rights and Amnesty International. The company's annual report to 
shareholders now includes a section entitled "Working Toward Sustainable 
Development," in which it reports on its progress on environmental issues. See 
Freeport's website <A href="http://www.fcx.com">www.fcx.com</A>. </P>
<P>The operations of the U.S.-based oil, gas, and chemical company Occidental 
Petroleum Corporation in a remote area of Colombia have enmeshed the company in 
an increasingly complex controversy that involves the cultural rights of an 
indigenous people, one of Colombia's oldest guerrilla armies, and bilateral 
relations between the Governments of Colombia and the United States. Occidental 
Petroleum is currently planning to drill for oil in an area that lies in a 
predominantly forest region in northern Colombia and is believed to hold 
anywhere from 1.4 to 2.5 billion barrels of oil. The area in question is claimed 
tribal homeland of the indigenous U'wa tribe people, whose leaders have opposed 
drilling on their land.</P>
<P>U'wa opposition to Occidental's plans have led to violent confrontations 
involving the loss of lives. In February 2000, three U'wa children reportedly 
drowned in a river after fleeing from government troops that were called in to 
break up an anti-Occidental demonstration. According to the Rainforest Action 
Network, the U'wa's have threatened to commit mass suicide if Occidental is 
allowed to follow through with its plans. Leftist rebels of the National 
Liberation Army (ELN), which have long attempted to disrupt multinational 
petroleum operations in Colombia, have exploited the situation. RAN website <A 
href="http://www.ran.org">www.ran.org</A>. RAN began its corporate 
responsibility campaigns since its inception in 1985 aimed at "convincing key 
corporations to respect endangered forest ecosystems and the rights of 
indigenous peoples." It mobilizes its 30,000 members and 150 Grassroots 
Rainforest Action Groups (RAN's), building alliances with environmental 
activists and attracting media attention. RAN's Beyond Oil Campaign: Occidental 
Petroleum in Colombia targets Oxy, Fidelity Investments (largest Oxy 
Shareholder) and Al Gore who is a shareholder. Beyond Oil's tactical elements 
include a Campaign 'News Site' on Ran's website as well as related articles from 
newspapers around the world and' ten things you can do to help the U'wa.<BR>ELN 
leaders promised to escalate military action against multinational oil 
companies, while expressing sympathy for the U'wa's plight. The ELN is 
responsible for hundreds of bombings of Occidental's Cano Limon line, which have 
had a major impact on Occidental's profits, and have devastated the surrounding 
environment.</P>
<P>In the Sudan, where thousands of people have been killed and thousands more 
displaced in a brutal civil war between the Muslim regime in Khartoum and rebels 
in the Christian and animist black South, the operations of the Canadian company 
Talisman Energy and other multinational oil companies are under attack by a 
coalition of NGOs and religious groups. The companies are accused of fueling the 
civil war by supplying equipment used by the Khartoum Government in human rights 
abuses against civilians and funding its repressive activities through their 
royalty payments. The Canadian Government's 'Harker Report' confirmed that 
Talisman's oil operations are exacerbating the conflict in the Sudan, and that 
the Khartoum regime is responsible for grave human rights abuses, including the 
systematic enslavement of children and women. In response to these criticisms, 
Talisman is now drafting a corporate responsibility report to be audited by 
Price Waterhouse Cooper of London, and is developing a human rights monitoring 
programme that will include training its own security forces to respect human 
rights. See Amnesty International's recent report "Sudan the Human Price of Oil" 
for further details.</P>
<P>ExxonMobil/Chevron/Petronas, the World Bank, and the Governments of Chad and 
Cameroon have formed a consortium to finance a $3.7 billion 663-mile oil 
pipeline from southwestern Chad through Cameroon, to the Atlantic coast. Under 
guidelines issued by the World Bank, which supplied 3% of the funds, the 
Government of Chad pledged that 80% of the revenues it received would be devoted 
to social programmes benefiting education, health, infrastructure and 
agricultural projects. Several independent panels with representatives from 
international agencies, NGOs and business have been set up to oversee the 
financing and construction of the pipeline.</P>
<P>Although the project was presented as a model for new partnerships in order 
to prevent oil revenues from being diverted to corrupt government officials - it 
was thrown into question in December with the announcement that Chad's President 
Deby had used $4.5 million of the Government's first oil receipts to buy 
weapons. World Bank officials were highly critical of the arms purchases, and 
warned that they could disqualify the country from debt relief that could save 
it almost $12 million a year. "We cannot defend new projects in Chad if they 
violate agreements with us," said Robert Calderisi, World Bank Director for 
Chad. "People are going to be very, very skeptical and reluctant to help Chad if 
they misuse the money." Washington Post, December 4, 2000 and e-monitors.</P>
<P>In Burma, a country widely criticized for its human rights abuses, many 
companies, including Texaco and the former Atlantic Richfield have ceased their 
operations, but Total and Unocal have remained - despite intense international 
criticism. According to Le Monde, "These two companies, which joined with 
Myanmar Oil and Gas to exploit the Yadana gas deposits and build a pipeline, are 
accused of profiting from human rights violations committed by the Burmese 
military in a dozen villages in connection with this work." In 1996, EarthRights 
International, a human rights and environmental group issued a report urging 
Unocal, Total, and Premier to "immediately withdraw" because "violence and 
forced labor in the pipeline region have continued unabated." EarthRights also 
reported that the military had been responsible for "suppression of dissent, 
environmental destruction, forced relocation, torture, and summary executions." 
e-monitors, May 31, 2000</P>
<P>Unocal was sued in an action arising out of its involvement in a gas pipeline 
project in Burma under the Alien Tort Claims Act (ACTA), a US law that allows 
aliens to sue in the US Courts for Torts for damages inflicted outside US 
borders -- including those resulting from human rights abuses. On 31 August 
2000, the US District Court for the Central District of California dismissed all 
claims against Unocal, ruling that the company could not be held liable because 
it had not participated in the human rights abuses committed by the Burmese 
military. The opinion acknowledged, "[t]he evidence does suggest that Unocal 
knew that forced labor was being utilized and that the Joint Ventures benefited 
from the practice." Plaintiffs are appealing the decision to the Ninth Circuit.

<H4>2. The Diamond Sector</H4>
<P>As the International Herald Tribune recently put it:</P>
<P>"Where they are mined responsibly, as in Botswana, South Africa or Namibia, 
diamonds can contribute to development and stability. But where governments are 
corrupt, rebels are pitiless and borders are porous, as in Angola, Congo or 
Sierra Leone, the glittering stones have become agents of slave labor, murder 
and wholesale economic collapse." "To Some Countries, Gems Bring Only Misery" 
The International Herald Tribune, April 7, 2000.</P>
<P>The issue of conflict diamonds was brought to public attention by a unique 
combination of NGO campaigning and reporting by international and national 
government agencies. In 1999, Global Witness, in partnership with two other 
NGOs, launched an international consumer campaign - called "Fatal Transactions" 
Global Witness operates in areas where natural resources and environmentally 
destructive trade is funding conflict or human rights violations. Reports 
include A Crude Awakening: The Role of the Oil and Banking Industries in 
Angola's Civil War and the Plunder of State Assets; Conflict Diamonds: 
Possibilities for the Identification, Certification and Control of Diamonds; A 
Rough Trade: The Role of Companies and Governments in the Angolan Conflict. <A 
href="http://www.oneworld.org/globalwitness">www.oneworld.org/globalwitness</A>.- 
to address and publicize the issue of conflict diamonds. Several in-depth 
studies and initiatives followed, exposing key players in the business of 
conflict diamonds. </P>
<P>In March 2000, under the auspices of the Security Council, the Canadian 
Ambassador to the United Nations released the report of a six-month 
investigation that revealed that the two-year Angolan diamond ban, which had 
been imposed to stop UNITA from using diamonds to fund its civil war against the 
Angolan government, had been compromised by other African nations and by the 
Central Belgium diamond clearing-house. The report concluded that UNITA used the 
funds from diamond sales to buy small weapons from Bulgaria, and that at least 
three heads of African states received diamonds in return for goods and 
services. Written by Ambassador Robert R. Fowler. Report on website <A 
href="http://www.un.int/canada">www.un.int/canada</A>. A UN report released 
December 21, 2000 reportedly exposes a "clandestine international network of 
individuals who fly weapons into conflict areas of Africa." The report states 
"that rebels in Angola mined diamonds worth more than $150 million in 1999 to 
finance their war against the government and that they sold the gems directly to 
diamond cutters, through tenders held in third countries, and on the open market 
in South Africa." Financial Times, December 22, 2000 A similar report by the 
Institute of Security Studies, "Angola's War Economy," funded by the Government 
of Finland, analyzed what it called "the Angolan 'abundant resource' war". 
Written by Jakkie Cilliers, Christian Dietrich. To order: <A 
href="mailto:Thandi@iss.co.za">Thandi@iss.co.za</A>.</P>
<P>In response to this wave of criticism, De Beers, the world's leading producer 
of diamonds, formally ended its purchases of Angolan diamonds, and adopted a 
policy of refusing to buy diamonds from conflict zones.</P>
<P>In July of 2000, the United Nations Security Council voted to impose an 
international ban on the purchasing of diamonds from Sierra Leone's rebels, 
seeking to cut off the financing for a civil war that had already taken the 
lives of tens of thousands of people. The resolution established the diamond 
embargo for 18 months, a timeframe that could be extended if the Government does 
not reassert its authority over Sierra Leone's diamond mining areas, 90 percent 
of which remain in rebel-held territories. This ban is significant in that the 
diamond industry is now seeking to work with governments and the UN to develop a 
system of "certificates of origin". These actions have not ended the trade in 
conflict diamonds, and the issue remains high on the agenda of the international 
community.</P>
<H4>3.The Financial Sector</H4>
<P>Because the financial industry is so closely connected to the corporations it 
finances, it has also been the focus of NGO campaigns to promote transparency 
and social responsibility in international lending and investment.</P>
<P>As part of its campaign on behalf of the U'wa tribe in Colombia, the 
Rainforest Action Network (RAN) has targeted Fidelity Investments, which is a 
major investor in Occidental. RAN has also commenced a "Campaign for a Sane 
Economy", targeting Citicorp as a "key financial player in many of the world's 
most destructive projects." Some of the projects they have identified include 
the Chad/Cameroon pipeline and the Three Gorges Dam in China. The RAN's website 
also cites Citigroup as "a top funder of new logging, mining and oil projects" 
and indicates that the corporation "is ranked fifth in the world among 
financiers of oil exploration and development." </P>
<P>Recently, eleven leading banks, including Chase, Societé General, and 
Deutsche Bank, and the NGO Transparency International (TI), an anti-corruption 
organization, agreed to a "know your customer" rule that seeks to prevent 
corruption and criminal activities by investigating the sources behind third 
parties opening accounts under suspicious circumstances. The new rule is aimed 
at banking schemes that enable corrupt government officials to divert public 
funds to their own personal use and disguise other illegal activities including 
arms trading.</P>
<H4>4. Other Sectors</H4>
<P>A 1995 report by Global Witness, "Forests, Famine, &amp; War—The Key to 
Cambodia's Future," described how trade between Thailand and Cambodia's timber 
industry was funding the Khmer Rouge in its civil war against the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RGC). The report asserted that the Khmer Rouge was 
earning $10 to $20 million each month, and that the timber profits were funding 
human rights abuses as well as creating severe environmental problems in 
Cambodia. </P>
<P>As a direct result, the IMF froze the next (US$20 million) tranche of its 
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and threatened the lapsing of 
this support if the Cambodian Government failed to implement forestry reforms. 
The IMF was true to its word and in November 1996, the ESAF lapsed. This strong 
action placed forestry at the top of the international agenda for Cambodia. The 
international community convened a meeting of donors in Tokyo in February 1999. 
With political stability, and the country at peace for the first time in 30 
years - the meeting would be able to address the core issues of Cambodia's 
reconstruction and rehabilitation.</P>
<P>The donors' meeting identified the need for independent monitoring to ensure 
the Cambodian Government's compliance with the promised forestry reforms. The 
IMF's re-engagement and the World Bank's new Structural Adjustment Credit were 
conditional on the signing of the deal. Global Witness was appointed to this 
official independent monitoring role. The appointment of a watchdog NGO to this 
kind of role is probably unique in world terms. This deal was funded in the 
first year by a $600,000 grant from Britain's DFID, and a $150,000 grant from 
AusAid, channeled through the FAO. The independent monitoring role is part of 
the recently established Forest Crime Monitoring Unit, which is also made up of 
inspection teams from the Forestry Department and the Ministry of Environment of 
Cambodia.</P>
<P>The increasing number of dams being built worldwide has lead to questions 
regarding their impact on the environment, local communities, displacement of 
population, and proper compensation. The case most covered by the media and NGOs 
is that of the Three Gorge Dam in China. In a novel approach to solving the 
conflict that may ensue for these types of infrastructure development projects, 
the World Commission on Dams was formed in 1998. Its two main objectives 
are:</P>
<P>To review the development effectiveness of dams and assess alternatives for 
water resources and energy development, and <BR>To develop internationally 
acceptable criteria and guidelines to advise future decision-making in the 
planning, design, construction, monitoring, operation, and decommissioning of 
dams. <BR>Most significantly, it reflects the assumption that global public 
policy issues can no longer be addressed without the active participation of 
governments, the private sector, and civil society. The Commission's 12 members 
were chosen to reflect regional diversity, expertise, and stakeholder 
perspectives, with each Commissioner serving in his or her individual capacity. 
The Commission is independent and none of the Commissioners represents a 
specific organization or country. It deals with issues addressing broader 
considerations such as water and energy policy, as well as more specific 
technical and policy-oriented questions such as resettlement, compensation for 
affected communities, and watershed impacts." - See <A 
href="http://www.dams.org">www.dams.org</A>.</P>
<P><BR>Virginia Haufler Virginia Haufler, "Does Business Have a Role in Conflict 
Management?" in Turbulent Peace, editors Chester Crocher, Pamela Aall and Fen 
Osler Hampson (United States Institute of Peace, forthoming). points out the 
possible roles that other non-extractive industries might play in promoting 
peace:</P>
<P>· Industries that sell directly to consumers, including clothing, athletic 
shoes, and rug manufacturers rely on their reputation and brand name. This makes 
them particularly sensitive to being associated with violent conflict. They tend 
to withdraw from localities where war has broken out. In unstable areas, they 
are likely to adopt corporate codes of conduct that address human rights issues. 
These light industries are the first ones that many countries need during 
post-conflict reconstruction. <BR>· The travel and tourism industries have a 
direct interest in peace, and are becoming more active in promoting peace. 
American Express and others engage in peace promotion activities.<BR>· 
Information industries can provide the infrastructure to rebuild after conflict. 
They can also provide tools for other groups to engage in conflict management 
programmes. Cisco Systems is building and running Internet Academies in Rwanda, 
to train people to use information technologies and to create a regional 
information center.<BR>· Media industries can be used as a tool to promote 
tolerance and democratic change, and to facilitate the work of civil society 
groups and international organizations that are involved in conflict management 
activities.</P>
<P>On a CNN interview broadcast 3 January, 2000 Shimon Peres observed that 
access to fresh water is a key source of conflict in certain regions, but can 
also present unique opportunities for peacemaking initiatives: "There are many 
ways to save water and to produce water. Water may be the watershed between 
peace and war in the Middle East. We spent over $100 billion over the last ten 
years to acquire arms. Would we invest the same amount of money to produce water 
or use [recycled] water, we would enjoy peace and prosperity at the same time . 
. . If we shall together try and bring in a real plan to supply water to all the 
needed parties of the Middle East, it can be both good business and a great 
contribution for peace."</P>
<H3><BR>II- Partnerships in Zones of Conflict</H3>
<H4>1. Government, Business and NGO Initiatives</H4>
<P>A very recent development in the effort to address the issues affecting 
businesses in zones of conflict has been the creation of innovative strategies 
involving unique coalitions of government, business and NGOs. </P>
<P>On 20 December, 2000 the governments of the United States and Great Britain 
finalized the "Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights," a 
groundbreaking agreement by several major oil and mining companies to 
voluntarily support a set of human rights principles governing their use of 
security forces in foreign operations. In the statement announcing the accord, 
the Governments of both countries described it as part of "a continuing 
dialogue" to assist multinational companies "in maintaining the safety and 
security of their operations within an operating framework that ensures respect 
for human rights and fundamental freedoms." Excerpt from the Statement by the 
Governments of The United States of America and The United Kingdom, on 
'Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights'-US Dept. of State.</P>
<P>The initiative is unique and significant for two reasons. First, it 
demonstrates that multinational corporations working closely with governments 
and non-governmental organizations can develop practical solutions to human 
rights problems that businesses face when operating in zones of conflict. 
Second, the accord is significant because the participants include many 
corporations that have been principal targets of NGO campaigns aimed at the 
extraction industry, and many of the NGOs who have waged those campaigns. The 
companies that initially signed the principles include Texaco, Chevron, BP, 
Conoco, Freeport McMoRan, Rio Tinto and Royal Dutch/Shell. The non-governmental 
organizations agreeing to the principles were Amnesty International, Human 
Rights Watch, Business for Social Responsibility, Fund for Peace, International 
Alert, Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, Council on Economic Priorities 
and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. <BR>In April 2000, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Bennett Freeman, noted 
that the accord was important not least because:</P>
<P>"The extractive sector holds tremendous potential for progress in terms of 
companies recognizing and assuming new roles and responsibilities in ways that 
do not take companies too far in the direction beyond their basic business 
concerns. Many prominent companies agreed to these principles because they make 
good business sense." Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Freeman's statement at 
the Business and International Security Conference held by the International 
Peace Forum with the New York University Center for Law and Business, 29 April, 
2000. The conference addressed challenges of companies working in partnerships 
with NGOs, multilateral institutions and governments in international conflict 
situations. For a conference summary go to 'events' <A 
href="http://www.intlpf.com">www.intlpf.com</A>.</P>
<H4>2. Business Association/ NGO Initiatives</H4>
<P>Three NGOs, The Council on Economic Priorities, International Alert, and The 
Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, recently published a groundbreaking 
report, "The Business of Peace," which provides a framework for understanding 
both the positive and negative roles that business can play in situations of 
violent conflict. PWBLF promotes corporate social responsibility through 
training and education. It is supported by 60 major global companies and 
presents human rights as an integral part of risk management and reputation 
assurance. CEP is a US-based organization that examines the social and 
environmental policies of multinational corporations. IA focuses on conflict 
resolution and peacebuilding and believes "The private sector, from large 
multinationals to small local businesses, has a vital role to play in creating 
wealth, promoting socio-economic development and contributing to the prevention 
and resolution of violent conflict." In its examination of over 30 countries and 
a variety of industry sectors, the report asserts that "both domestic and 
multinational companies have an increasingly important role to play in conflict 
prevention and resolution" and that "in today's global economy they also have a 
growing business rationale for playing this role."</P>
<P>"The Business of Peace" makes a strong argument for the proposition that 
business has an interest in promoting conflict resolution: </P>
<P>"There are 72 countries where the security risk for the majority of locations 
in which foreign business operates is rated medium, high or extreme for 2000. 
Today, only about 4% of the world's GNP is military related; 96% of the 
international business community provides civilian products and services. Most 
of these business sectors have a vested interest in stability and peace." The 
Business of Peace, page 5.</P>
<P>The report argues that the private sector can no longer afford to ignore the 
causes and costs of conflict. It outlines some of the key factors that determine 
whether business plays a negative role by creating or exacerbating violent 
conflict or a positive role by helping to tackle it. </P>
<P>The report identifies six principles through which business can make a 
positive contribution to conflict prevention and resolution: (i) strategic 
commitment; (ii) risk and impact analysis; (iii) dialogue and consultation; (iv) 
partnership and collective action; (v) evaluation; and (vi) accountability. 
These principles encourage a company to adopt measures such as creating 
guidelines to incorporate human rights into the company's operations, 
communicating with people in the community affected by the company's operations, 
and examining the impact of its business activity on conflict.</P>
<P>The report also provides numerous encouraging examples of the principle of 
"partnership and collective action" between the private sector, multilateral and 
non-governmental organizations for conflict prevention, crisis management, and 
post-conflict reconstruction. </P>
<H4><BR>3. Business/NGO Initiatives </H4>
<P>The many examples of successful business/NGO initiatives provide clear 
illustration of the gains that can be achieved when both sides are willing to 
explore existing opportunities:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The 'Partnership for Quality Medical Donations (PQMD)' is a new group that 
  includes leading pharmaceutical companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and 
  Merck, as well as voluntary organizations like AmeriCares and International 
  Aid. Their projects aim at promoting greater effectiveness in provision of 
  voluntary medical aid and services to developing countries including zones of 
  conflict.</LI>
  <LI>In Ireland, Oracle worked with the State of the World Forum to donate 100 
  internet-ready computers to Catholic, Protestant and nonsectarian schools in 
  Belfast as part of a program called 'Computers for Coexistence'. </LI>
  <LI>In Kosovo, DHL helped to re-establish distribution of mail and parcels and 
  put in place the necessary logistics for continued service.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>&nbsp;In the Balkans, the Swiss-Swedish construction company ABB has 
  encouraged diversity and improved ethnic relations in the workplace by 
  bringing Serbs, Kosovars and Bosnians together to work on re-building war 
  damaged electricity infrastructure.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>&nbsp;In the Middle East tourism professionals and desert guides from 
  Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority are working together to develop 
  regional tourism packages and the Shimon Peres Center, which promotes business 
  links between Palestinian and Israeli companies, and the International 
  Institute for Peace Through Tourism brought officials from over 60 countries 
  to Jordan for a conference on peace and tourism.</LI>
  <LI>In Southern Africa, the Peace Parks Foundation helps partnerships between 
  governments, the private sector and local communities to promote conservation, 
  eco-tourism and job creation across national boundaries.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>In Washington DC, the NGO Fund for Peace, has created a 'Business and 
  Human Rights Roundtable' bringing together human rights activists, government 
  leaders and business leaders to talk about their common goals of respecting 
  human rights. This group reached an agreement on a set of six 'Joint 
  Statements of Principles of Representatives of the Business and Human Rights 
  Communities' to be used by the roundtable to examine case studies and develop 
  practical solutions for business and human rights.&nbsp;</LI>
  <LI>&nbsp;In New York, "The Coexistence Initiative," founded in 1996, focuses 
  on how NGOs that are engaged in coexistence work might work productively with 
  the business sector. It is now looking at how to "translate" the lessons 
  learned and best practices documented in The Business of Peace and other 
  reports into practical resources — handbooks, workshops, etc.</LI>
  <LI>In Northern Ireland, Future Ways and Counteract are two NGO's helping 
  companies to promote tolerance, diversity and interdependence between the 
  Catholic and Protestant communities.</LI></UL>
<P>Many other conflict resolution and peacebuilding NGOs are available to assist 
companies looking for guidance and partners in this developing area. Dr. David 
Hamburg, President Emeritus of the Carnegie Corporation, recommends groups like 
the Carter Center, the Conflict Management Group, Search for Common Ground and 
Harvard University's Program on Strengthening Democratic Institutions in the 
Former Soviet Union as good sources of advice and possible partners for business 
working in regions of conflict. According to Dr. Hamburg, "the activities of 
these groups include monitoring conflicts, providing early warning and insights 
into a particular conflict, convening the adversarial parties in a neutral 
setting, paving the way for mediation and carrying out education and training 
for conflict resolution." </P>
<H4>4. Business/Multilateral Organization Initiatives</H4>
<P>Recognizing the new role that business can play in peacebuilding, 
multilateral organizations have called upon corporations to assist in working 
toward global development and peace. The genesis of these efforts dates to the 
end of World War II, when the business community actively promoted the creation 
of the United Nations to further its interest – and the world community's -- in 
avoiding the destructive effects of war and violent conflict.</P>
<P>Examples of the types of partnerships that have developed include high-tech 
and telecommunications that have proven to be important partners for 
disaster-relief: Immarsat's satellite phone were donated to the International 
Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), and Microsoft's designed computerized 
registration system for the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees during the 
crisis in Kosovo. Novel internet partnerships with international organizations 
include IBM's support of the ICRC's website and Cisco Systems' support of UNDP's 
NetAid.org initiative, which has raised over 12 million dollars and mobilized 
the involvement of 3,000 NGO's and 200 corporations to support humanitarian 
causes. Ericsson, the telephone company, has a partnership with the United 
Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Red Cross to 
establish a major Disaster Response Programme, providing communication aid for 
humanitarian relief workers.</P>
<P>In 1997 the World Bank created the Post-Conflict Unit as part of its social 
development department. The unit advises the Bank on how its lending policies 
can help to prevent conflict and promote social cohesion, while at the same time 
promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. It also gives grants for 
economic initiatives that promote regional stability and supports research on 
the potential of cross-sector partnerships and the role of the private sector in 
post-conflict resolution. In May 2000, the Post-Conflict Unit entered into 
partnership with PeaceWorks (which calls itself a "not-only-for-profit" gourmet 
foods company), the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), and 
Guatemala's Industries for Peace network and an association of exporters to 
build new businesses among former adversaries in Guatemala.</P>
<P>The most significant development in this area has been the United Nations' 
"Global Compact," initiated by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to 
harness the energy and influence of multinational corporations in promoting 
human rights and avoiding conflict: "Announced by United Nations 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 
in January 1999, and formally launched at United Nations Headquarters in July 
2000, the Compact calls on companies to embrace nine universal principles in the 
areas of human rights, labour standards and the environment. It brings companies 
together with United Nations organizations, international labour organizations, 
NGOs and other parties to foster partnerships and to build a more inclusive and 
equitable global marketplace. It aims, in the words of Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan, to contribute to the emergence of "shared values and principles, which 
give a human face to the global market." UN Global Compact Brochure</P>
<P>The European Center for Conflict Prevention and Transformation is now 
encouraging the European Union to "endorse and support the UN Global Compact and 
include a commitment in EU policy documents to engage the private sector as a 
partner in furthering EU development and conflict prevention objectives and make 
such a commitment explicit in a EU declaration." The Center also calls for the 
EU to "consult and work with the private sector on issues which address the root 
causes of conflict, including: institution-building, equitable distribution of 
resources, anti-corruption measures, poverty eradication, human rights promotion 
and protection, security sector reform." The European Platform for Conflict 
Prevention and Transformation <A 
href="http://www.euconflict.org">www.euconflict.org</A> an open network of 
European and international NGO's involved in the prevention and/or resolution of 
conflict in the international arena. Its mission is to facilitate networking, to 
encourage co-operation and facilitate the exchange of information as well as to 
develop advocacy and lobbying activities among participating organizations. It 
acts as the secretariat of the European Platform for Conflict Prevention and 
Transformation. The paper from this quote is "Preventing violent conflict: 
Opportunities for the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies of the European Union in 
2001"</P>
<H3><BR>Conclusion</H3>
<P>One of the realities of doing business in the global marketplace is that 
managers in multinational corporations find themselves operating in areas of 
armed conflict, indigenous cultural disputes, epidemic disease and other kinds 
of social upheaval. As globalization of the world's economy continues, the 
international business community will increasingly find itself confronted with 
the challenge of promoting peacebuilding in its areas of operation, or being 
blamed for contributing to the conditions that lead to violent conflict. These 
new challenge will increasingly require business professionals to apply conflict 
resolution and peacebuilding strategies in situations where promoting peace is 
an essential element of successful business operations.</P>
