<font face="Arial">There is consensus that empowering women to participate fully in economic life
across all sectors and throughout all levels of economic activity is essential to build strong
economies, more stable societies, and achieve internationally agreed goals for development and
human rights. Experience shows that crafting approaches and policies that result in empowering
women requires a particular understanding of the gender dimensions of the context and impact
sought. Yet, until recently, guiding principles for business to advance women in the global
marketplace have not been articulated.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">In 2004, the investment firm Calvert, in collaboration with the United Nations
Development Fund for Women--UNIFEM, developed the first global voluntary code of conduct guiding
business on how to empower, advance and invest in women worldwide. 
<sup>1</sup> The Calvert Women’s Principles bring together a variety of ways in which business can
contribute to the advancement of women. While the response to the Women’s Principles has been
strong and positive, many have suggested bringing together an array of global stakeholders to
discuss how to promote and implement these goals around the world.</font>
</p>
<div>
<strong>
<font face="Arial">Consultative Process with Business and Stakeholders</font>
</strong>
</div>
<div>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Therefore, the UN Global Compact and UNIFEM are organizing the 
<strong>“Advancing Women’s Position in the Global Marketplace” event</strong> on 
<strong>5 March 2009</strong> at 
<strong>UN Headquarters</strong> in 
<strong>New York</strong>. Based on interest from companies and others, the UN Global Compact and
UNIFEM will launch a consultative international process around opportunities and obstacles for
business in working with such a set of Women’s Principles, especially in the current context of the
global economic crisis. The process will feature dialogue around the potential global application
of the Women’s Principles, and how they might be operationalized, including what business would
need in the way of guidance materials and other assistance to support their implementation.
Importantly, it will also seek input on the current content of the Women’s Principles to further
enhance their international impact and reach. In collaboration with business and other stakeholders
worldwide, the process will develop a robust global business case for the Women’s Principles,
illustrated with examples of good business practice.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Broad participation in the process is sought to ensure that it captures global
and local perspectives from large and small businesses in a variety of industries, as well as other
societal actors. Subject to business interest in further engagement on the Principles, the UN
Global Compact and UNIFEM, together with Calvert, are keen to explore opportunities for developing
a voluntary engagement platform, with concrete guidance to support company implementation of the
Women’s Principles in order to empower, advance and invest in women world-wide. Participation in
the process will not commit any participant to adopt the Principles.</font>
