          <h1>The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on the Issue of Human Rights and
Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises</h1>In 2005, the United Nations Human
Rights Commission requested that the UN Secretary-General appoint a Special Representative (SRSG)
with a mandate for three years to, among other things; 
<ul>
<li>identify and clarify standards of corporate responsibility and accountability for businesses
and human rights;</li>
<li>clarify the implications for businesses of concepts such as “complicity” and “sphere of
influence”;</li>
<li>develop materials and methodologies for undertaking human rights impact assessments of the
activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises;</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">After three years of work on his 2005 mandate, the SRSG proposed
a conceptual policy framework to the United Nations Human Rights Council. The framework is
organized around the three foundational principles of “protect, respect, and remedy”: the state
duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate
responsibility to respect human rights; and the need for more effective access to remedies.</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The UN Human Rights Council welcomed the SRSG’s work, including
the framework, and, on 18 June 2008, renewed his mandate for 3 years to, requesting him among other
things to:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">elaborate further on the scope and content of the corporate
responsibility to respect all human rights and to provide concrete guidance to business and other
stakeholders;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">identify, exchange and promote best practices and lessons learned
on the issue of transnational corporations and other business enterprises, in cooperation with the
efforts of the human rights working group of the Global Compact;</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">For further information about the SRSG mandate and to access all
reports and materials produced by or submitted to the mandate please go to the&nbsp;

the UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights</a>.</p>
<h2>
<font face="Arial">Relevance for the UN Global Compact</font></h2>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The SRSG’s framework adopted by the UN Human Rights Council is relevant to the
UN Global Compact, in particular, the SRSG’s elaboration of&nbsp; corporate responsibility to “
respect” human rights and of “complicity”, which are some of the main concepts in UN Global Compact
Principles 1 and 2.</font></p>
<h3>Due Diligence</h3>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The work of the SRSG on business and human rights has shown that all human
rights have the potential to be relevant to all businesses, regardless of sector or country of
operation. It also emphasizes that respecting human rights means not causing harm to human rights.
Exercising "due diligence" in identifying and managing human rights risk will help business respect
human rights and avoid complicity in human rights abuse.
<br /> &nbsp;
<br /> The responsibility to respect human rights and to thereby not cause harm is the baseline
standard for all companies in all situations. Companies should exercise due diligence to become
aware of, prevent and address adverse human rights impacts linked to their activities.</font></p>
<p>The due diligence process should consider three sets of factors: the country contexts in which
the companies operates; the potential and actual human rights impacts resulting from the company’s
activities; and the relationships connected to those activities. How far or how deep this process
must go will depend on the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Sphere of Influence</h3>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Many participants in the Global Compact are keen to go beyond the avoidance of
causing harm to help support/promote the enjoyment of human rights. This is encouraged - Principle
1 of the Global Compact speaks of supporting human rights as well as respecting them.&nbsp;
Socially responsible companies will typically also have a broader capability and often desire to
support the promotion of human rights within their sphere of influence. Likewise, stakeholder
expectations often extend to the belief that companies can and should make a positive contribution
to the realization of human rights where they are in a position to do so.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The concept of "sphere of influence" can help map the scope of a company's
opportunities to support human rights and make the greatest positive impact. While these
opportunities may be greatest with respect to a company's own operations and workers, the ability
to act gradually declines as consideration moves outward to the supply chain, to local communities,
and beyond. In some cases, companies may wish to increase their leverage or sphere of influence
through collaboration with other actors. The assessment of the opportunities for action and
leverage will depend on the particular circumstances, some specific to the company and some
specific to the context in which it operates.
<br /></font></p>

<h2>
<font face="Arial">Interview with John Ruggie, UN Special Representative on Business and Human
Rights</font></h2>
<p>Understanding human rights responsibility and accountability is very much a work in
progress.&nbsp;There continue to be many grey areas for companies: What are they expected to do in
their operations and where? Should governments be in the driving seat? What constitutes complicity
in&nbsp;rights abuses? John Ruggie was appointed UN Special Representative on Business and Human
Rights with a view to clarifying such key issues.</p>

<h2>The Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights</h2>
<strong>Briefing on the work of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Business
and Human Rights
<br /> May 2009</strong>
<br />
</div>
<br /> 
<strong>What is the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Business and Human
Rights?</strong>
<br />
<br /> The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Business and Human Rights, Professor
John Ruggie of Harvard University (SRSG), was appointed in 2005 to clarify the role and
responsibilities of business with regard to human rights. He reports to the United Nations Human
Rights Council. 
<sup>[1]&nbsp;</sup>
<br />
<br /> 
<strong>What is the framework that he proposed?</strong>
<br />
<br /> In June 2008, after extensive consultations with business, governments and civil society on
five continents, the Special Representative proposed a policy framework for managing business and
human rights challenges. It is based on three pillars: (1) the 
<strong>state duty to protect</strong> against human rights abuses by third parties, including
business; (2) the 
<strong>corporate responsibility to respect</strong> human rights; and (2) greater 
<strong>access to remedy</strong>, judicial and non-judicial, for victims. &nbsp;
<br />
<br /> 
<strong>What happened to the framework?</strong>
<br />
<br /> The United Nations Human Rights Council was unanimous in welcoming the framework, and
extended the SRSG’s mandate by three years with the task of operationalizing it. &nbsp;
<br />
<br /> 
<strong>What is the corporate responsibility to respect?
<br /></strong>
<br /> The corporate responsibility to respect human rights means that companies must act with due
diligence to 
<strong>avoid infringing on the rights of others</strong>. In addition to complying with national
laws, the corporate responsibility to respect human rights is the baseline expectation for all
companies in all situations. Companies may take on additional responsibilities voluntarily, and in
some situations, such as when they perform certain public functions, more may be required of them.
&nbsp;
<br />
<br /> The responsibility to respect is a core principle of the UN Global Compact (Principle 1:
Business should respect and support the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights). It
is also recognized by virtually every voluntary initiative and features in such soft law
instruments as the ILO Tripartite Declaration and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises.
<br />
<br /> 
<strong>What can companies do to discharge the responsibility to respect?</strong>
<br />
<br /> While important progress has been made, relatively few companies have systems in place
enabling them to support with confidence claims that they respect human rights. What is needed
therefore is a 
<strong>due diligence</strong> process whereby companies become aware of, prevent, and address
adverse human rights impacts. &nbsp;
<br />
<br /> Core elements of human rights due diligence are:
<br /> 
<ol>
<li>having a human rights policy;</li>
<li>assessing human rights risks and impacts;</li>
<li>integrating human rights throughout a company;</li>
<li>having a mechanism to handle grievances; and</li>
<li>tracking, as well as reporting performance.</li>
</ol>Tools and resources that can help a company to exercise due diligence can be found at: 
<a

<br />
<br /> 
<strong>What is the appropriate 
<em>scope</em> of a company’s human rights due diligence process? What factors does it need to
consider?</strong>
<br />
<br /> Three are essential:
<br /> 
<ul>
<li>The first is the country and local 
<strong>context</strong> in which the business activity takes place. This might include the
country's human rights commitments and practices, the public sector’s institutional capacity,
ethnic tensions, migration patterns, the scarcity of critical resources like water, and so on.</li>
<li>The second factor is what 
<strong>impacts</strong> the company’s own activities may have within that context, in its capacity
as producer, service provider, employer and neighbour, and understanding that its presence
inevitably will change many pre-existing conditions.</li>
<li>The third factor is whether and how the company might contribute to abuse through the 
<strong>relationships</strong> connected to its activities, such as with business partners,
entities in its value chain, other non-State actors, and State agents.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Which human rights are relevant for companies?</strong>
<br />
<br /> Companies have the potential to impact virtually all human rights, thus should consider all
human rights. For the substantive 
<strong>content</strong> of due diligence (that is, for the human rights to consider), companies at
a minimum should look to the International Bill of Human Rights - the Universal Declaration and the
two Covenants - as well as the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (the
Global Compact’s Labour Principles 3 to 6 are taken directly from this latter Declaration). They
should do so for two reasons. First, the principles these instruments embody are the most
universally agreed upon by the international community. Second, they are the main benchmarks
against which other social actors judge the human rights impacts of companies.
<br />
<br /> Companies might need to consider additional standards depending on the situation. For
example, in conflict affected areas they should take into account international humanitarian law
and policies; and in projects affecting indigenous peoples, standards specific to those communities
will be relevant.
<br /> 
<strong>
<br /> How is the framework relevant to the UN Global Compact?</strong>
<br />
<br /> The SRSG’s framework, as adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, is relevant to the UN
Global Compact on many levels. In particular, the SRSG’s elaboration of the corporate
responsibility to “respect” human rights as a baseline responsibility and of “complicity” (part of
the responsibility to respect), which are some of the main concepts in UN Global Compact Principles
1 and 2.
<br />
<br /> Many participants in the Global Compact are keen to go beyond the avoidance of causing harm
to help support/promote the enjoyment of human rights. Principle 1 of the Global Compact speaks of
"supporting" human rights as well as “respecting” them. Socially responsible companies will
typically also have a broader capability and often desire to support the promotion of human rights
within their sphere of influence. Likewise, stakeholder expectations often extend to the belief
that companies can and should make a positive contribution to the realization of human rights where
they are in a position to do so. Many companies are involved in efforts to support/promote human
rights at the local and/or global levels. This is encouraged by the UN Global Compact. &nbsp;
