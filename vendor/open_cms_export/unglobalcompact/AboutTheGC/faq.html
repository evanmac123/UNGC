          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>1. How do companies participate in the UN Global Compact?</h2>
<p>As a voluntary initiative, the UN Global Compact seeks wide participation from a diverse group
of businesses. As a participant in the Global Compact, a company:
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Sets in motion changes to business operations so that the Global Compact and its principles
become part of strategy, culture and day-to-day operations;</li>
<li>Is expected to publicly advocate the Global Compact and its principles via communications
vehicles such as press releases, speeches, etc; and</li>
<li>Is required to communicate with their stakeholders on an annual basis about progress in:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">
<ol>
<li>Implementing the ten principles and</li>
<li>Undertaking partnership projects in support of broad UN goals.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>The 
<a target="_self" href="../COP/index.html">Communication on Progress</a> (COP) is an
important demonstration of a participant’s commitment to the Global Compact and its principles.
Failure to provide a COP will result in a non-communicating or inactive status for a participant &ndash;
a necessary measure to protect the integrity of the initiative. 
<p>Companies have the added opportunity of participating in a number of Global Compact-sponsored
initiatives and programs. 
<a target="_self" href="../HowToParticipate/Business_Participation/index.html">More
information on how to participate can be found here.</a></p>
<h2>2. Who can join the Global Compact?</h2>
<p>Participation in the Global Compact is open to any company that is serious about its commitment
to work towards implementation of the Global Compact principles throughout its operations and
sphere of influence, and to communicate on its progress.&nbsp; Properly constituted (under
prevailing national law) companies from any industry sector are eligible for participation, except
those companies involved in the manufacture, sale etc. of anti-personnel landmines or cluster
bombs, companies that are the subject of a UN sanction or that have been blacklisted by UN
Procurement for ethical reasons.&nbsp; Remaining in good standing requires communicating the
company's progress in implementing the principles, respecting the Policy on the Use of the Global
Compact Name and Logos, and a willingness to engage in dialogue under the integrity measures in the
event that a matter is raised under those procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. How can non-governmental organizations and other non-business participants get
involved?</h2>As equal partners and important stakeholders, 
<a target="_self" href="../HowToParticipate/civil_society/index.html">civil
society</a> and other non-business organisations can participate through a number of Global Compact
engagement mechanisms, including Policy Dialogues, Learning, 
<a target="_self" href="../NetworksAroundTheWorld/index.html">Local Networks</a> and<a target="_self" href="../Issues/partnerships/index.html">Partnership Projects</a>.
In these areas, such organizations have a crucial role to play in helping to foster partnerships
and produce substantive action. Non-business participants are also encouraged to commit their
organization to the ten principles and to report on progress made within their organization. 
<h2>4. Is the Global Compact legally binding?</h2>No. The Global Compact is a purely voluntary
initiative. It does not police or enforce the behavior or actions of companies. Rather, it is
designed to stimulate change and to promote good corporate citizenship and encourage innovative
solutions and partnerships.
<br />
<h2>5. Is the Global Compact a substitute for existing regulatory approaches?&nbsp;</h2>Absolutely
not. The Global Compact views itself as complementing other voluntary initiatives and regulatory
approaches by helping to establish the business case for human rights, labour standards,
environmental stewardship and the fight against corruption. The Global Compact is a purely
voluntary initiative designed to promote innovation in relation to good corporate citizenship. Many
of the existing standards support the principles of the Global Compact and are therefore are quite
consistent with its overall objectives. 
<h2>6. Why should a company that has already established its own code of conduct participate in the
Global Compact?</h2>Corporate codes of conduct are extremely important and many companies have
demonstrated leadership and positive change through their development and implementation. The
Global Compact is not a code of conduct. Rather, it offers a policy framework for organizing and
developing corporate sustainability strategies while offering a platform - based on universal
principles - to encourage innovative initiatives and partnerships with civil society, governments
and other stakeholders 
<h2>7. Are there any financial obligations in becoming a Global Compact participant?&nbsp;</h2>The
Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, not a formal membership organization. As such, we do not
collect any fees for core funding. The Global Compact only accepts core funding from government
donors. However, the Global Compact encourages financial contributions and sponsorships to support
non-core activities through the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalcompactfoundation.org/">Foundation for the Global
Compact</a>. 
<h2>8. I operate an organization with less than 10 employees. Can I still participate in the Global
Compact?</h2>Due to administrative constraints, organizations with less than ten direct employees
(micro enterprises) will not be entered into the participant database. However, we encourage micro
enterprises to stay informed about all Global Compact activities via this website and to engage
with their Global Compact country network. Network information can be found in the 
<a target="_self" href="../NetworksAroundTheWorld/index.html">Networks Around the
World</a> section of this website. 
<h2>9. Can company subsidiaries join the Global Compact?</h2>
<p>The Global Compact applies the leadership principle. If the CEO of a company's global parent
(holding, group, etc.) embraces the Global Compact by sending a letter to the UN Secretary-General,
the Global Compact will post only the name of the parent company on the global list assuming that
all subsidiaries participate as well. Subsidiaries that wish to directly send a letter to the
Secretary-General, to underline their commitment, will be listed as participants, and are invited
to become active in the Global Compact country network of their host country.</p>
<h2>10. What if my company chooses to no longer participate in the Global Compact?</h2>
<p>The Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, and signatories are free to end their
participation at any time. However, as the initial commitment to the Global Compact requires a
letter from an organization's top executive, the same is expected in order to leave the initiative.
The letter should be addressed to the UN Secretary-General and specify the organization's reasons
for ending the commitment.</p>
<p>Please note: the Global Compact Office reserves the right to make the participation and
departure letters public.</p>
<h2>11. If there is no monitoring or enforcement, how does the Global Compact know that a company
is truthfully portraying its actions?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Global Compact is not a performance or assessment tool. It does not provide a seal of
approval, nor does it make judgments on performance.</p>
<p>Participants are expected to publish in their annual report or similar corporate report (e.g.
sustainability report) a description of the ways in which they are supporting the Global Compact
and its ten principles. This is known as the 
<a target="_self" href="../COP/index.html">Communication on Progress</a>. The Global
Compact believes that this sort of openness and transparency encourages good practices by
participants (see question 6 below).</p>
<h2>12. Does the UN Global Compact have teeth?</h2>
<p>Focused on learning, dialogue and partnerships, the UN Global Compact is more like a guide dog
than a watch dog. However, the Global Compact has a mandatory disclosure framework - the 
<a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/COP/">Communication on Progress (COP)</a>. Business
participants are required to communicate their progress to their own stakeholders on an annual
basis and to post a copy on the Global Compact's website. Failing to communicate progress on an
annual basis results in a downgrading of participant status from active to non communicating.
Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are de-listed and the Global
Compact publishes their name. Non-communicating and de-listed companies, can become active again
only by posting their COP.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>13. Isn't there a danger of companies using UN logos and their affiliation with the UN and the
Global Compact to "blue-wash" their operations that might actually be harming
society?&nbsp;</h2>The Global Compact has developed its own logo, which is used frequently in
official Compact documents and publications. The use of the Global Compact image is strictly
regulated and the same restrictions apply to its use as the general United Nations logo. Those
policies are contained in the UN Business Guidelines, which can be accessed at 
<a target="_blank"
href="http://www.un.org/partners/business/otherpages/guide.htm">http://www.un.org/partners/business/otherpages/guide.htm</a>.<p>In addition, following the recommendations made by the working group of the Secretary General's
Advisory Council, the Global Compact adopted a set of integrity measures to safeguard the
initiative and to avoid potential abuse. They also encourage companies to communicate at least
annually to their stakeholders and the public at large on progress made in internalizing the
principles within their own operations and activities. Global Compact participants are also
expected to submit a short description and a web link to these communications to the Global Compact
and/or Global Compact local network website. Participants that do not submit such a description
within two years of signing on to the Global Compact will be removed from the list of participants
until a submission has been made.

<h2>14. Can tobacco companies join the Global Compact?
<br /></h2>
<p>The UN Global Compact Office supports the World Health Organization's efforts to raise awareness
of the serious health effects of tobacco use. It thus actively discourages tobacco companies from
participation in the initiative and does not accept funding from tobacco companies. It also does
not permit tobacco companies to make presentations at any of its global events or to use the global
brand in any other way to raise their profile. Since tobacco is a legal product whose use UN Member
States have not yet outlawed, the Global Compact Office is not able to exclude tobacco companies
from the initiative if they still wish to join. However, because the initiative is a learning and
dialogue platform and does not endorse or offer a seal of approval for participating companies, it
reinforces Government efforts to advance human rights, labour conditions, the environment and
anti-corruption, including as these areas relate to the tobacco industry. Until Member States
decide otherwise, tobacco companies should not be immune from the Global Compact's worldwide call
to all companies to embrace, support and enact within their sphere of influence the set of core
values in these areas. They should be expected to support and respect human rights, uphold labour
standards, respect the environment and avoid corruption.</p>
