 		UN Private Sector Forum Seeks Long-term Response to Global Food Crisis, Endemic Poverty</p>

          <p><h1>UN Private Sector Forum Seeks Long-term Response to Global Food Crisis, Endemic Poverty</h1>
<h2>World Business Leaders Hope to Generate New Commitments for Food Sustainability</h2>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<em>(New York, 24 September 2008/UN DPI)</em> - In a high-level afternoon programme opened by UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, animated by former United States President Bill Clinton and activist
musician Bob Geldof, and closed by World Bank President Robert Zoellick, the first ever United
Nations Private Sector Forum brought business, civic and Government leaders together to work with
the world body on a long-term response to the global food crisis and endemic poverty.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The Forum also launched the “Business Call to Action”, aimed at engaging private
enterprise in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, as well as the “Framework for
Business Engagement with the United Nations”, developed to more effectively mobilize private sector
efforts in that regard.&nbsp; Finally, the Forum included a series of round tables which analysed
the various challenges of sustainable development.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">“The talent and reach in this room is enormous,” the Secretary-General said as
he outlined the strategies and challenges involved in meeting the Millennium Development
Goals.&nbsp; “If you use it to help people who are suffering, we will all live in a more prosperous
and stable world.”&nbsp; To do that, “we need to bring in knowledge, resources and innovation in a
way that links sustainability with opportunities for growth”, he said, calling for stepped up
investment in agriculture and citing such examples as the company EcoProfit, which was helping to
produce compost for organic farming.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Mr. Ban outlined United Nations efforts in creating partnerships to end hunger,
including the Comprehensive Framework for Action on the food crisis.&nbsp;The Global Compact, the
United Nations initiative for responsible globalization that co-sponsored today’s event, had
brought together 5,000 businesses from more than 130 countries.&nbsp; He proposed a world summit,
to be held in 2010, on progress in meeting the Millennium Goals.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Following the Secretary-General’s remarks, Kemal Derviş, Administrator of the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), another co-sponsor of the Forum, introduced a number
of private sector leaders to speak on innovative practices that had led to hunger alleviation:
Marcel Bruiins, Secretary-General of the International Seed Federation, founded in the Netherlands;
A.Q.I. Chowdhury, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Finlay International Limited, an
agricultural company in Bangladesh; Nirmala Gihan Wickremeratne, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Hayleys PLC of Sri Lanka, which is concerned with water management; and Chad Holliday,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the DuPont Corporation and past President of the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development.&nbsp; They described initiatives ranging from efforts
to develop drought-tolerant maize varieties and improved rice, to agricultural enterprises that
created decent work, and strategies to use water efficiently and boost productivity.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Mr. Derviş also introduced Leonel Fernández, President of the Dominican
Republic, who described the extensive Global Compact network that had been built in his
country.&nbsp; Converting economic growth into social benefits for all citizens and assisting
neighbouring Haiti, however, remained great challenges, he noted.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Launching the Business Call to Action, which was conceived by the Government of
the United Kingdom at the United Nations in 2007, Mr. Derviş noted that the world spent $1.3
trillion on arms and more than $1 trillion on importing oil.&nbsp; A plan to spend $700 billion to
prop up investment banks was now under consideration.&nbsp; In that context, the amount of
investment it would take to increase sustainable development around the world was not
daunting.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, said the best way for the Business Call to
Action to bring about results was to bring together the partnerships represented by the
participants present.&nbsp; “We know exactly what has to be done,” he said, adding, however, that
increased will, effort and investment were needed.&nbsp; Successes in Africa should encourage such
efforts, he maintained, referring to the establishment of enterprises in Rwandan villages by
Ericsson and other firms.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Douglas Alexander, Secretary of State for International Development of the
United Kingdom, urged participants to sign on.&nbsp; “Working together, the contribution we can
make will be significant, indeed historic.”&nbsp; The mechanisms created by the Government of the
United Kingdom would help track commitments and compile best practices.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Introducing the seven round tables into which participants were then divided,
John Holmes, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator,
said that, even though some food commodity prices were falling, there was absolutely no sign that
the food crisis was over.&nbsp; A large portion of the world was still hungry, while small farmers
and developing countries in general needed investment to become more productive.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The round tables discussed the following topics:&nbsp; water access and
management; agricultural inputs and infrastructure; financial mechanisms and risk management
instruments; nutrition; energy and biofuels; the role of technological innovations; and job
creation for low-income populations.&nbsp; Conducted in a closed session, their results will be
shared during the sixty-third General Assembly’s high-level meeting on the Millennium Development
Goals tomorrow, 25 September, according to the Global Compact Office.</font>
</p>

<font face="Arial">In his presentation, Mr. Clinton said that, during his entire presidency, all
discussions about food had been related to subsidies paid to growers and the provision of food
relief.&nbsp; There had been almost no discussion about increasing people’s ability to grow, store
and market their own food.&nbsp; Recently, the World Bank President had admitted that the
institution had followed a mistaken strategy by failing to invest in small producers, and it now
had to make up for the consequent severe organizational and investment shortfalls plaguing
smallholder agriculture.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Mr. Clinton said he was so excited about a change in the World Bank’s strategy
that he had immediately called Mr. Zoellick and pledged his support.&nbsp; However, out of
necessity, the world would have to turn much more to local agriculture for its needs.&nbsp; In
developing countries, though, outside investment and know-how were needed to overcome problems of
growing, storing and distributing food in addition to credit difficulties.&nbsp; There had been
decades of “system neglect”, which Governments could not overcome on their own.&nbsp;
Private-sector investment was crucial.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Describing a project of the Clinton Foundation to grow and market Rwandan coffee
in a more profitable way, he said that the Millennium Village project provided models for efficient
small agriculture, which, however, must be comprehensively put in place in African countries.&nbsp;
Hopefully the Forum could encourage them to adapt the models to their needs, working with
international organizations and the private sector.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Mr. Geldof said it was disgraceful that, in an affluent world, hunger was still
increasingly affecting people by the tens of millions each year.&nbsp;The initiative to halve
extreme poverty by 2015, launched in 2000 was, therefore, one of the greatest efforts begun in
modern times.&nbsp; The huge subsidies paid to agriculture in the developed world should be
dispersed among developing countries.&nbsp; A logical approach to the business of Africa was
needed.&nbsp; There was nothing “exotic” separating the continent economically from the rest of the
world.&nbsp; “Why aren’t you there?” he asked the business leaders present.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Closing the Forum, Mr. Zoellick said there was no doubt that there would be a
financial rescue for the current economic crisis, but there must also be a human rescue for the
food crisis.&nbsp; Inclusive and sustainable globalization must be created, with a focus on
reducing the vulnerability of those at the bottom.&nbsp; International institutions must also be
bolstered, since resources were only available for short-term objectives at the moment.&nbsp; To
build agricultural production over the medium and long term, particularly in Africa, immediate
attention must be paid to property rights, seed quality, irrigation systems to overcome
vulnerability to drought, and a host of marketing problems.&nbsp; The World Bank intended to
increase its investment in those areas by about $4 million to $6 million per year.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">With the right policies and the right private-sector engagement in Africa, a
real difference could be made, he said.&nbsp; One of the big issues following the financial crisis
would be developing a non-monolithic “flexible network system” of finance, of which the private
sector would be an important part, and which would adapt itself to various areas in different
ways.&nbsp; It was an opportunity to make all areas of the globe economically viable, incorporating
climate change concerns into the effort.</font>

<p>
<font face="Arial">In addition to the Global Compact Office and UNDP, other organizers of the Forum
were the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Department for Economic and
Social Affairs and the United Nations Office for Partnerships.&nbsp; Additional support was
provided by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the United Nations Environment
Programme and the International Labour Organization.&nbsp;Georg Kell, Executive Director of the
Global Compact, moderated today’s programme.</font>
