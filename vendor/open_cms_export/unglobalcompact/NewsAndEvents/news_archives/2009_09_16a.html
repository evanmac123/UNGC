          <p><h1>UN Global Compact Executive Director Addresses Private Equity Community</h1>
<p>
<br />(<em>New York, 16 September</em> 
<em>2009</em>) 
<font face="Arial">&ndash;</font> Georg Kell, Executive Director of the United Nations&nbsp;Global
Compact, addressed the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference in New York today.
The&nbsp;following is the text of his speech (<em>please check against delivery</em>):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>Introduction</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">It is a great pleasure to speak to you today.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">I am grateful to the organizers for inviting me and I wish to commend them for
the courage to do so. After all, this may well be the first time that a UN bureaucrat has addressed
the Private Equity community in such an important setting.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">My sincere hope is that following our interaction, we will begin to see that
Private Equity and the United Nations have some important common objectives &ndash; objectives that
relate to the creation of a more sustainable and stable global economy.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">At this point, you may be wondering what on earth the UN and Private Equity
could possibly have in common? Isn’t this the proverbial oil-and-water scenario? &ndash; the world’s most
global intergovernmental organization whose mission is peace, development and human rights; and
Private Equity, the efficiency-driven offspring of modern capitalism whose focus &ndash; at least in the
minds of many &ndash; is on sizing up market opportunities and restructuring business &ndash; the “art of
financial performance”, as it has been called.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">One important answer came earlier this year when the Private Equity Council
officially adopted a set of guidelines resulting from collaborative discussions with the UN-backed
Principles for Responsible Investment &ndash; a network of some 550 institutional investors representing
roughly $18 trillion in assets.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">These guidelines, while not widely known or referenced at this early stage,
represent a true milestone in many respects. And I wish to commend the Private Equity Council and
its members on this important step.
<br /> In essence, these guidelines recognize that the management of environmental, social, and
governance &ndash; or so-called “ESG” issues &ndash; can be material to business and asset performance and
therefore should be considered and incorporated into both investment analysis as well as the
management of the underlying asset. The guidelines make explicit reference to the UN Global
Compact, which as some of you may know provides companies and their management teams with a
strategic policy platform to manage ESG issues.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">I will return to this connection in a moment, but wish to first provide a bit of
context.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>Context</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">I think we can all agree that we are in the midst of profound transformations.
With the shadows of the Great Recession still looming in many places, it is clear that over three
decades of deregulation have largely come to an end.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Meanwhile, the global economic center of growth is shifting to Asia, while at
the same time the political will to sustain market openness is, unfortunately, weakening in many
parts of the world. One of the greatest experiments ever &ndash; building a rules-based, open economy
that has enabled hundreds of millions of people to lift themselves out of poverty, that ensures
that technology and innovation diffuse rapidly around the globe, that connects cultures and people
and that ultimately is our best bet to create a peaceful and prosperous world &ndash; hangs in the
balance.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Finally, we are faced with a true systemic emergency &ndash; climate change, which
threatens to disrupt societies and markets around the world, and if unaddressed could reduce global
economic output by an estimated 20 percent by mid-century.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The stakes 
<u>could not</u> be higher.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">At the same time, there is increasing consensus that today’s global threats and
challenges &ndash; be they related to the economic and financial upheaval, the climate crisis, or other
urgent environmental and social issues &ndash; are too large, interconnected and complex for any one
sector to solve alone.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">This is why the United Nations is beginning to reach out &ndash; to form new, and
sometimes unlikely partnerships to address these challenges.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Collective action and collaboration is the order of the day.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>The UN’s Transformation</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">It may helpful to step back briefly in time to understand the radical nature of
the change that has occurred within some parts of the UN &ndash; change that has brought the United
Nations closer to the worlds of business and finance, and brought me to this conference
today.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">As recently as the late 1990s, indifference and mutual suspicion characterized
the relationship between the UN and business, the result of the long decades of the Cold War. This
began to change with the launch of the Global Compact ten years ago, when the UN started to reach
out to business, inviting companies to align their operations with ten universal principles,
covering human rights, workplace issues, the environment and anti-corruption.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The idea was that by embedding global markets in shared values, by offering
opportunities for collective action through learning, dialogue and partnerships, greater
sustainability for markets could be achieved while ensuring that the benefits of economic
efficiency spread faster and wider. Business executives were asked to make the principles part of
strategy and operations and to disclose progress made on an annual basis.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Let me be clear &ndash; this was not an exercise in philanthropy but rather a new
management paradigm that sees ESG issues as integral to long-term business success. The UN, for its
part, would offer collaboration, partnership opportunities and a neutral space for solution
finding.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">What started as an experiment, with only 47 companies present at its launch in
July 2000, has grown into the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative with
over 6,000 business participants and stakeholders from more than 130 countries.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The companies represent almost every conceivable industry and sector, and hail
from both developed economies and emerging markets. Moreover, while the Global Compact includes
some of the biggest public companies in the world, more than half of business participants are
privately held, and include both large and small enterprises. Your firms no doubt have ownership
interests in many of these.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Why are management teams joining the Global Compact &ndash; at the present rate of
nearly 100 companies per month?</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Certainly, the ethical imperative of addressing ESG issues remains as important
today as it did ten years ago &ndash; some say more so given the recent crisis in markets and the related
erosion of trust in business.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">But questions of risk management, improving productivity, reducing costs and
sizing new opportunities by making the Compact and its principles part of business strategy and
operations have established themselves as additional and arguably far more potent drivers of the
agenda.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Indeed, the business case for what we call corporate sustainability &ndash; that is,
the management of ESG issues &ndash; is increasingly clear. As the authors of a major article on
corporate sustainability argue in this month’s Harvard Business Review: “In the future, only
companies that make sustainability a goal will achieve competitive advantage”.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">We have countless examples of companies that are generating value-enhancing
benefits &ndash; including securing new revenue streams; lowering operating costs; attracting the best
talent; and generally enhancing their corporate and brand reputations.
<br /> &nbsp;
<br /> And markets appear to be recognizing these new realities.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">For instance, a recent study by RiskMetrics of the equity performance of our 70
top publicly traded companies in terms of their disclosure on sustainability practices found that
the group has consistently outperformed the global market by an average of 7.3 percent since March
2007. In fact, the index beat the MSCI in every quarter during the past two years, including during
the worst months of the crisis.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Similar studies by Goldman Sachs support the premise that effectively managing
ESG issues can contribute to market out-performance.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Of course, we must keep in mind that the core goals of the UN and the private
sector are different. But in today’s interconnected world the imperative of market sustainability
calls for collaboration and the private sector is an important part of the solution.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">My central message to you today is that the United Nations increasingly
understands this and in some quarters have developed capacities to partner, both with business and
investors.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The UN and the private sector share common interests, including:</font>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Building markets to advance development and reduce poverty;</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Investing in clean and efficient technologies to tackle climate change;</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Advancing good workplace practices through the supply chain; and</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Introducing good governance policies and anti-corruption measures.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>The Principles for Responsible Investment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">With respect to investors, our work has centered on the Principles for
Responsible Investment, co-launched by the Global Compact and our sister agency, UNEP FI, just over
three years ago in partnership with institutional investors. Indeed, the PRI is today led and
governed largely by institutional investors, all of whom are Limited Partners.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The rationale for launching the PRI included the following key
observations:</font>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">ESG issues can be material to investors, especially over the long term.
Investors who do not take these issues into account are putting the interests and returns of their
beneficiaries at risk.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Institutional investors, especially when working together, can have significant
influence as owners and clients over companies, fund managers, consultants and brokers and can use
this influence to encourage improvements in ESG performance by companies.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Three years ago there was no global framework in place to point investors in the
right direction or to define this new era of Responsible Investment based on materiality, as
compared to traditional SRI approaches.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Negotiated and drafted by a group of institutional investors and other experts,
the Principles for Responsible Investment were launched in April 2006 at a special event at the New
York Stock Exchange. Covering areas such as investment policy, active ownership practices,
collaboration and disclosure, the six core Principles are designed to place ESG considerations into
the heart of investment analysis and decision-making.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Let me be clear that the PRI is not an SRI initiative in the sense of employing
negative screens or taking value judgments on companies or industries. Likewise, the focus is not
on narrow clean-tech or other such specialized social funds. Rather, PRI recognizes that
incorporating ESG issues into investment analysis, and improving the management of ESG issues
within all companies and assets in the portfolio, can help maximize long-term investment objectives
&ndash; while, at the same time, aligning the investment community with larger societal goals. In other
words: a double dividend.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">As with the growth of the Global Compact, the PRI has surpassed our wildest
expectations. The more than 550 signatories are divided roughly in half between asset owners and
asset managers, with a third category of service providers.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Signatories to the PRI are demonstrating an unprecedented level of collaboration
and partnership as they work together to encourage investee companies or potential investments to
improve their ESG performance &ndash; for instance, by joining and implementing the Global
Compact.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">From its inception the PRI was designed to be relevant to all asset classes,
which ultimately led to the discussions with the Private Equity community.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>Why Should Private Equity Care?</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Clearly, the Private Equity industry &ndash; be it related to buyout, mid-stage, or
venture capital &ndash; is a major force in international finance and in driving business
innovation.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">In addition to being investors, you are also business managers and employers &ndash;
with a vital stake, I would argue, with respect to the role of business in society. In many
aspects, you are much closer to the fabric of economies and communities than your publicly traded
peers.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">For these and related reasons, I would suggest, society’s expectations with
respect to Private Equity will only increase.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">And frankly, I believe Private Equity has an enormous opportunity to get out in
front of the trends and demonstrate a new level of leadership &ndash; leadership that contributes both to
your success as investor-managers, as well as to aligning your objectives with broader social goals
&ndash; thereby building public trust in the industry.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Fixing firms, and creating long-term value, is your business. Yet, up until now,
ESG considerations &ndash; especially with respect to environmental and social issues &ndash; have arguably not
figured very prominently in your investment and management decisions. This is the prevailing view
held by many Limited Partners in the PRI who feel that Private Equity managers give less regard to
ESG risks and opportunities than public-equity fund managers.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Rather than reacting to trends and negative headlines, why not begin to seize a
leadership position?</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Allow me, please, to suggest the following:</font>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">As investment firms, embrace the new-era of “Responsible Investment”, sign the
PRI, and actively incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making. [The recent
launch by the PRI of “Responsible Investment in Private Equity: A Guide for Limited Partners”.
While this resource is focused on Limited Partners, it was developed by both LPs and GPs and
indirectly offers guidance for GPs.]</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">As investor-managers, sign your portfolio companies to the Global Compact. As a
voluntary initiative with a straightforward disclosure component, the Compact offers your firms a
learning platform to develop, implement and report on sustainability policies and practices. And
encourage your portfolio company managers to look at the list of companies that are already engaged
in the Global Compact &ndash; and ask them whether they might be missing anything.</font>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Embrace more transparency. Opaque industries and companies become lightning rods
for criticism &ndash; deserved and undeserved. The reporting dimension of the Global Compact offers one
way of demonstrating transparency, but there are other avenues, including taking part in more
public policy discussions on key ESG issues and becoming a more active member of the corporate
responsibility community.</font>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<font face="Arial">I have one final suggestion. On 24-25 June of next year, we will be holding the
UN Global Compact Leaders Summit &ndash; to coincide with our 10-year anniversary. The Summit, taking
place here in New York, will feature business and government leaders from both developed and
developing economies from around the world. I wish to invite you, leaders from the Private Equity
community, to this event and to begin to consider the development of a deliverable or contribution
to this Summit. This will be a historic opportunity for participants to share their work in the ESG
space before a global audience of key decision-makers.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">It is indeed a sign of the times that you invited me here today.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">I feel strongly that we are in the midst of a historic convergence between the
goals and interests of the United Nations, on the one hand, and those of business and finance on
the other.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">It is time to cast off old ideas and caricatures. I hope I have conveyed the
transformation the UN has undergone in recent years and the initiatives we have pursued to engage
new partners.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The good news for Private Equity is that these platforms now exist, and offer a
range of immediate and longer-term benefits.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">In the final analysis, we share a desire to create sustainable, stable, and
inclusive markets. This is good for business, good for investment, and good for peace, security,
and development.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Thank you.</font>
