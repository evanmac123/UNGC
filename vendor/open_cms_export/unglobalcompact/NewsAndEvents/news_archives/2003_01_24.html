          <H1>Summary of Annual Learning Forum Meeting</H1>
<H2>2003-01-24&nbsp;</H2>
<P>The annual Global Compact Learning Forum Meeting, which was held in Berlin 
from 11-13 December 2002, had three objectives: i) sharing and discussing good 
practices of corporate behavior around the nine principles, ii) identifying 
knowledge and learning gaps; and iii) identifying possible topics for the 2003 
Global Compact Policy Dialogues. <BR>The meeting convened more then 200 
participants from all over the world. During the two-day meeting, 
representatives from over 100 companies, labour, international civil society 
organizations, leading business schools and universities as well as governments 
and UN agencies focused on issues related to the Global Compact’s nine 
principles and transparency. </P>
<P>HIV/AIDS in the Workplace: There was an overall consensus that more can and 
should be done to fight HIV/AIDS and its consequences in the workplace. The ILO 
code of conduct on HIV/AIDS at the workplace was widely supported by 
participants. However, there was agreement that greater efforts are needed to 
distribute the code (documented in an existing training manual) to companies, 
subsidiaries and plants. One overriding question focused on what areas the 
workplace activities have been most effective in the fight against HIV/AIDS: 
education, treatment, prevention, stigma? Participants raised concerns about the 
increasing gap between workers and their communities vis-à-vis health-care 
coverage. Companies expressed the need for further knowledge on issues such as: 
How to develop a policy, engage workers and management, and mobilize 
communities? How to strengthen the public-sector capacity to take on HIV 
treatment? What public-private partnerships have been successful? </P>
<P><STRONG>Cross Border Supply Chain Management:</STRONG> The working group on 
cross border supply chain management discussed the need for common binding 
standards and streamlining of auditing procedures. The concept of “do no harm” 
was transformed into the concept of “do good”. Also, participants proposed the 
sharing of examples of bad practices as they can offer significant value in a 
learning context. Participants asked for more clarity on and understanding of 
the principle “compliance with human rights”. A proposal was made to analyze the 
effectiveness of different approaches such as partnerships, financial incentives 
and trainings. The question was raised on how far responsibility of various 
supply chains stretches. Participants agreed that ending a relationship with a 
supply chain partner in the event that problems are identified is not the right 
way forward. Rather, joint efforts should be made to find solutions. In 
addition, it is important that the public have an understanding that such an 
approach entails a process of change and improvement. The participants proposed 
to continue working within the Global Compact on these issues. </P>
<P><STRONG>From Principles to Practice</STRONG>: This working group discussed 
the experiences and problems of integrating the nine principles into core 
business operations. Participants were unclear about how the human rights 
principles should be implemented at operational level. The definition of “second 
generation human rights issues” was the subject of discussions. It was proposed 
to better define and elaborate the exact meaning and implications of those 
principles for company conducts. The following questions were raised and 
remained unanswered: How can independent verification and monitoring be best 
developed? How can the business performance as a whole be effectively measured 
similarly as for example costs are? Participants felt the need for more 
analytical case studies; the dissemination of best practices; and a professional 
guide to the principles. </P>
<P><STRONG>Transparency and Corruption</STRONG>: The working group on 
transparency and corruption tackled complex and sensitive issues such as 
bribery, antitrust, publishing data and related public policies. The working 
group proposed to continue developing more information, knowledge and 
understanding on the issues of bribery and transparency. It was felt that there 
is a need for a greater exchange of experiences related to: the level playing 
field of competitors (integrity pacts); confidentiality clauses; due diligence; 
sectoral initiatives; and, in general, good practice by companies and 
governments. The UN convention on transparency was welcomed. The proposal by 
Transparency International to introduce a tenth principle to the Global Compact 
principles was presented briefly and discussed during plenary. In the evaluation 
of the meeting, participants were in favor of transparency as a concept but the 
opinions on whether to add an additional principle varied. </P>
<P><STRONG>The Global Compact Performance Model and GRI</STRONG>: These were 
presented and discussed. The participants raised issues such as honesty in 
reporting and the leadership cost of transparent reporting. Participants raised 
the concern that NGOs tend to focus more on the transparent companies than on 
those that do not report at all, thereby punishing positive efforts. The 
applicability of GRI as a reporting instrument for SMEs was questioned. 
Participants proposed to work on the role of the Global Compact (mission, goal) 
in its relation to reporting. In addition, participants noted that the case for 
the long-range financial return of applying the nine principles has still not 
been made. What is the business case? Participants proposed that the Global 
Compact provide more examples of good practice in order to set global 
benchmarks, while emphasizing the Performance Model and its related tools. More 
tools should be developed. Participants suggested two research themes: why 
specific companies are not reporting and the implications of the NGO strategy of 
attacking companies that are reporting data thus punishing efforts toward 
greater transparency. </P>
<P><STRONG>Products, Profits, Development</STRONG>: This working group 
emphasized the need for tools and communication instruments to assess and 
measure sustainable development; to create socially conscious consumers and 
learn how to market to them; and to develop better knowledge of what ecological 
efficiency means — and appropriate tools for assessing such efficiency. In order 
to advance product development with the GC’s principles in mind, greater 
understanding of partnership processes and collaboration is also needed, along 
with education on recycling policies, climate change, and the processes that 
companies use to move toward more sustainability. To develop this knowledge and 
these tools will likely require greater collaboration among companies that are 
‘on this path,’ more sharing of methods, tools, and instruments used, which 
could be accomplished through meetings in various parts of the world. In 
particular, the group thought that sector- and region-specific working groups 
could be helpful, along with UN agency forums on specific issues, such as worker 
health and productivity, sustainability, and the like. </P>
<P><STRONG>Sustainable Management</STRONG>: This working group raised a 
diversity of topics and issues, including the following questions: How can 
companies involve local communities and other stakeholders in the early phases 
of planning investments abroad? How should impact be measured? How should 
companies operate in countries where relevant legislation and data does not 
exist? Concerns were raised about the tactics of some NGOs that might lead 
companies to pull out of a region, creating a vacuum for corporate “cowboys” 
with little interest in responsible management? Banks also should take a leading 
role in supporting sustainable management through their investment policies. 
</P>
<P>The need for greater integration of SMEs into the work of Global Compact was 
expressed by most working groups. In general, participants also agreed that more 
experiences – good and bad – should be documented, analyzed and shared. And 
finally, greater efforts should be made to involve more participants from 
developing countries in the Global Compact. </P>
<P><STRONG>Follow-Up </STRONG></P>
<P>The Global Compact Office has analyzed the full reports of the different 
working groups and will, in consultation with the Advisory Council, take up the 
following priority issues for Policy Dialogues and/or Learning in 2003: </P>
