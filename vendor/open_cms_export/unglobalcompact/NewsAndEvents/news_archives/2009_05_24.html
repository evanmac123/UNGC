          <p><h1>UN Secretary-General Calls for Greening the Global Economy, Encourages Pro-Climate Advocacy by
Business</h1>
<h2>Speaking at the World Business Summit on Climate Change, Ban Ki-moon urges business leaders to
push for a fair and effective global climate change agreement in Copenhagen this December</h2>
<p>
<em>(Copenhagen, 24 May 2009)</em> - 
<em>The following is the text of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's opening remarks at the World
Business Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen:</em></p>
<p>Your Majesty,
<br />Royal Highness,
<br />Excellencies,
<br />Distinguished guests,
<br />
<br />I am delighted to be here.&nbsp; Perhaps more important, I am glad you have chosen to take
the time to be here today.
<br />
<br />We meet at a critical moment in human history.
<br />
<br />Our planet is warming to dangerous levels.&nbsp; In December, the UN Climate Change
Conference will meet here in Copenhagen to find solutions to this grave global threat.
<br />
<br />As business leaders, you are crucially placed to ensure that government negotiators seal a
deal.
<br />
<br />We are enduring the worst economic downturn since [the] 1930s.&nbsp; It is essential that we
do not allow this to hold back the political momentum, investment and innovation that we need to
combat climate change.
<br />
<br />Climate change is the defining challenge of our time.&nbsp; I also believe it is the most
potent game-changer for business over the next century.&nbsp; It is an opportunity we must seize.
<br />
<br />Today, I want to challenge you.&nbsp; I want to see you in the vanguard of an unprecedented
effort to retool the global economy into one that is cleaner, greener and more sustainable.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />You and your colleagues have the ingenuity and vision to lead by example where others &ndash;
including governments &ndash; are lagging behind.
<br />
<br />With your support, and through your example, we must harness the necessary political will to
seal the deal on an ambitious new climate agreement in December here in Copenhagen.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This will not be easy.&nbsp; Fundamental change never is.&nbsp; But, if we get it right, we
can reasonably look forward to sustained growth and prosperity.
<br />
<br />If we get it wrong we face catastrophic damage to people, to the planet &ndash; and to the global
marketplace.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Excellencies, dear friends,
<br />
<br />Our excessive reliance on a fossil fuel-based economy is destroying our planet’s
resources.&nbsp; It is impoverishing the poor.&nbsp; It is weakening the security of nations.&nbsp;
And it is choking global economic potential.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The science is clear.&nbsp; Global emissions must peak in less than a decade to avert the
worst consequences of climate change.
<br />
<br />Many scientists are saying that worst-case projections are already being realized &ndash; indeed
surpassed.&nbsp; This was the message from the International Scientific Congress, held here in
Copenhagen in March.
<br />
<br />We know that the safest way of reducing climate risks is to reduce emissions.&nbsp; We know
that taking early action makes good business sense.&nbsp; And we know the cost of inaction will be
much bigger that the cost of inaction now.
<br />
<br />Some estimates say that rising greenhouse gas emissions could cause a decline of 5 per cent
or more in global GDP.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Compare that with what it would take to bring down greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, estimates that it could cost as little as 0.1 per
cent of global GDP each year until 2030.&nbsp; And that does not factor in the multiple extra
benefits to health and development.
<br />
<br />Most importantly, we know we have the tools to change course.
<br />
<br />What we need is political will, at the highest level, coupled with the right policy signals
and market incentives.
<br />
<br />In September I am convening a summit meeting on climate change at the UN headquarters in New
York to galvanize this political will among the political leaders.
<br />
<br />I am inviting all Heads of State and Government.
<br />
<br />Business leaders will also be a part of the conversation.
<br />
<br />A strong message from the business community to governments worldwide may make all the
difference.
<br />
<br />As business leaders, you must make it clear to your leaders that doing the right thing for
the climate is also the smart thing for global competitiveness and long-term prosperity.
<br />
<br />We may never get a better opportunity. And if the world’s scientists are right, we may not
get a second chance.
<br />
<br />Your Majesty, Excellencies, distinguished guests,
<br />
<br />We have seen how a local crisis &ndash; a bank failure, a disease outbreak &ndash; can quickly go
global.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />We live in an interconnected world.&nbsp; An effective agreement in Copenhagen would be a
powerful vote of confidence in multilateralism.&nbsp; By the same token, failure would be bad news
for everyone.
<br />
<br />But there is yet another vitally important reason why we must seal a deal in December in
Copenhagen.
<br />
<br />We know that the right kind of deal will provide the regulatory certainty and long-term price
signals that businesses are demanding.&nbsp; We know that a deal can unleash investment, stimulate
innovation and facilitate the global spread of low-carbon technologies.
<br />
<br />What is often overlooked is the impact a deal could have on global trade.&nbsp; Success in
Copenhagen could set a powerful example: if Member States can find a way forward on an issue of
such tremendous complexity, surely they can do the same in other areas, most notably the stalled
Doha round of trade talks.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, failure in Copenhagen could lead countries to turn inward in a misguided
effort to handle the climate challenge on their own.&nbsp; We could see new, climate-related
protectionist barriers.
<br />
<br />But such go-it-alone policies simply cannot work, for climate or for trade.&nbsp; They would
undermine the core principles of non-discrimination that the international trading system has been
building over the past six decades.&nbsp; They could lead to trade anarchy.
<br />
<br />So we need to seal a deal in December for these reasons, too.&nbsp; To protect the trading
regime.&nbsp; To enable trade to underpin development, spread green solutions and usher in the
green economy.
<br />
<br />Ladies and Gentlemen,
<br />
<br />Climate change affects every aspect of society, from the health of the global economy to the
health of our children.&nbsp; It is about the water in our wells and in our taps.&nbsp; It is about
the food on the table.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It is about energy security and international security.&nbsp; It is at the core of nearly all
the major challenges we face today
<br />
<br />That is why it is an issue for Heads of State.&nbsp; And that is why it is an issue for
business.
<br />
<br />So far, only a small portion of the business and investment community has made climate change
a strategic priority.&nbsp; Too many are sitting on the fence, waiting for others to act, or
waiting for the clear policies that will signal a level playing field.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Others are defenders of the old order.&nbsp; For those who are directly or implicitly
lobbying against climate action I have a clear message:&nbsp; your ideas are out of date, and you
are running out of time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />What the fence sitters and the skeptics fail to understand is that climate change
fundamentally changes the 21st century balance sheet.
<br />
<br />Sooner or later there will be a higher price on carbon &ndash; imposed either by policy or by
market forces.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Any multinational business that doesn't have a strategy in place to deal with climate change
will end up on the losing side of history.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />That is not where you plan to be.
<br />
<br />Investing now in green solutions is cheaper &ndash; and ultimately more profitable &ndash; than spending
more, later, in a catch-up race for global competitiveness.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Polluting industries have successfully cleaned up their act in the past.&nbsp; That is part
of the dynamic tradition of private-sector innovation.&nbsp; There are good examples today of
industries in the developing and developed worlds cutting emissions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I welcome such steps, and call for more.
<br />
<br />We must also invest in the lower-carbon economic winners of the future.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I know that some argue that we cannot afford to act on climate change during a global
recession.
<br />
<br />I disagree.&nbsp; What we cannot afford is more short-sighted approaches.&nbsp; The global
economy needs more than a quick fix.&nbsp; It needs a fundamental fix.
<br />
<br />If we have learned anything from the financial crisis, it is that we must put an end to
unethical and irresponsible behaviour and the tyrannical demand for short-term profit.
<br />
<br />The price of a global bail-out may seem high, but it will pale next to the enormous human and
economic costs of delaying action on climate change.
<br />
<br />Continuing to pour trillions of dollars into fossil-fuel subsidies is like investing in
sub-prime real estate.&nbsp; Our carbon-based infrastructure is like a toxic asset. that threatens
the entire portfolio of global goods &ndash; from public health to food security.
<br />
<br />We must direct investment away from dirty energy industries.&nbsp; It is time to create
market incentives that reward long-term investment in clean energy and innovation.
<br />
<br />Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
<br />
<br />The smart money is on the green economy.&nbsp; Many of you are already showing the way.
<br />
<br />You have shown that energy efficiency and green technologies can drive profitable
performance.
<br />
<br />Many of you are deeply engaged in the UN Global Compact.&nbsp; You are building a community
of businesses, which I hope will show that “caring for the climate” can be a new paradigm for
business success.
<br />
<br />Many of your good examples are featured in a series of new studies that will be unveiled
today under the “Caring for Climate” banner.
<br />
<br />Throughout this meeting you will share important lessons.&nbsp; You will showcase solutions
in construction, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and many more.
<br />
<br />These examples show that a transformation is possible.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />But to seize this transformation, we need the regulatory certainty and market signals that
only a binding global climate change agreement can provide.
<br />
<br />We need an agreement with clear long-term goals and mid-term targets.
<br />
<br />And we need your voice, your influence, and your example.
<br />
<br />You can help to seal a deal in December, and this is how you can do it:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I ask all of you to support the "Copenhagen Call" that we will issue at the end of this
meeting.&nbsp; Use your influence as business leaders to bring climate change to the attention of
policy makers and the public.
<br />
<br />Instruct your government affairs teams to lobby vigorously and relentlessly for a successful
outcome in Copenhagen in December.&nbsp; Do it now.&nbsp; And do it in every capital where you are
represented.
<br />
<br />Mobilize employees, partners, clients and customers to take a stand and demand climate action
from governments.
<br />
<br />Work with your trade associations and interest groups to ensure their lobbying supports an
effective Copenhagen agreement.
<br />
<br />Join the UN’s “Seal the Deal” campaign.&nbsp; Add your stamp to the global movement for
action.
<br />
<br />Above all, I encourage all of you to continue on the path of innovation and
collaboration.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Continue to spread green solutions through your supply chains.&nbsp; Continue to push for
private-sector solutions that reduce climate risks&ndash; in health, water and natural resources, in
insurance and investment and economic development.
<br />
<br />This, my friends, is the essence of business statesmanship in the 21st century.&nbsp; Send a
strong message to the governments that hold the keys to success in December.
<br />
<br />Tell them to seal the deal.
<br />
<br />Seal the deal to power green growth.&nbsp; Seal the deal to protect our planet.&nbsp; Seal
the deal to build a more sustainable, prosperous global economy that will benefit all nations.
<br />
<br />Your customers and your shareholders will reward you.&nbsp; And your children will thank you
one day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Thank you for your time.&nbsp; I wish you a most productive meeting.
<br />
