          <H2>Interviews / Q&amp;A's: </H2>
<H1>The Global Compact: Corporate citizenship - When the global ‘why’ meets the 
local ‘how’</H1>
<P><EM>In the first of Ethical Corporation’s new series of interviews with 
leaders, editor Tobias Webb speaks with Georg Kell, executive head of the United 
Nations Global Compact. This is an extended version of the interview that 
appeared in the magazine print edition in June 2006</EM></P>
<P>It seems appropriate to begin a series of interviews with leaders and company 
chief executives with Georg Kell, executive head of the United Nations Global 
Compact. </P>
<P>Few corporate citizenship initiatives have generated as much interest from 
companies, non-governmental organisations and the media as the compact. </P>
<P>Founded in 2000 by Kell, a former financial analyst turned UN adviser on 
trade and development, the Global Compact now has 3,000 members. </P>
<P>Kell and UN secretary-general Kofi Annan personally pushed its development to 
draw in business to help tackle global problems, which are broadly outlined in 
the compact’s ten principles, which signatories should attempt to adhere to. 
</P>
<P>Recent times have been busy for the compact. In the past few months it has 
launched a foundation to provide funding and a board to govern its direction, 
and has set in motion an initiative to transform international financial markets 
on sustainability issues. </P>
<H2>New board: a ‘critical element’</H2>
<P>On the issue of the new board, the creation of which seems in line with the 
compact’s pro-business outlook, Kell says it is “a critical element” in the 
maturing of the compact, from a small unit in the secretary-general’s office to 
a fully fledged entity. The Global Compact Office is now recognised by the 
General Assembly of the UN.<BR><BR>The compact has local 
networks of members working on the ten principles on a national basis. The new 
multi-stakeholder board, chaired by Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, former Shell chairman 
and current chairman of Anglo American, the mining company, is there to give 
“overall guidance” and to “steer the compact forward”, says Kell. </P>
<P>The board will oversee quality management, and will connect with local 
networks via an annual forum in Barcelona where local network representatives 
will discuss progress and share ideas. Sub groups and working committees may 
devolve from the board to tackle particular issues, Kell says. </P>
<P>Board members from business are geographically spread out, from Chile to 
India. This may help maintain a global perspective for the compact and allow 
input from business not just in Europe or the US, but also from regions where 
corporate citizenship needs to find its own local flavour, such as Latin 
America, Africa and Asia. It is about “connecting the global with the local 
level”, says Kell.</P>
<H2>The foundation</H2>
<P>The newly launched fundraising arm may solve a long-standing Global Compact 
problem: funding. The UN itself – with the equivalent of its annual budget spent 
every 33 hours by the Pentagon – is notoriously short of cash. </P>
<P>The compact has represented something of an energetic, unflagging microcosm 
of this over the past half decade, with only a handful of core staff begging and 
borrowing experts from institutions such as GTZ, the German development agency, 
or other arms of the UN, such as UN Environment Programme and UN Development 
Programme. Until now the Global Compact Office has been funded by a trust fund 
supported by ten governments. </P>
<P>These have encouraged the securing of complementary funding from Global 
Compact participants, says Kell, hence the creation of the foundation. The 
foundation is chaired by overall board chairman Sir Mark Moody-Stuart. </P>
<P>The idea is to raise $1 million a year to help the compact develop tools for 
members to help them live up to the compact’s ten principles and for 
strengthening local networks, particularly in developing economies. </P>
<P>Is the compact maturing? “Absolutely,” says Kell. The recent changes are to 
give the compact “an organisational underpinning to create growth”. Kell says a 
flexible business structure rather than a more top-down traditional bureaucracy 
works better for the compact. </P>
<P>“We borrowed heavily from the Visa model,” he says, referring to the 
money-transfer system that is used by companies worldwide. He also noted the 
influence of top NGOs Transparency International and Amnesty International on 
how the compact is now organising itself. </P>
<P>The Compact now has some 53 local networks, designed to help embed compact 
principles on a local, self-organising basis. Thirty of these are in developing 
countries, which are encouraged to compete with each other on a quality basis. 
“Their licence to operate has to be renewed on an ongoing basis,” says Kell. 
</P>
<P>He admits that comparisons between networks are tough, since starting points 
in, say, Brazil are very different from, for example, Ukraine or Pakistan, which 
have only just launched their local networks of firms. The compact has minimum 
standards that networks must adhere to, which are individually negotiated with 
the local network partners. </P>
<P>“Our next meeting will work out the incentives,” says Kell, under which local 
networks can become even more robust and more representative. This local flavour 
of global minimum standards is important to the compact as local networks use 
its name and brand, even though their structures vary to take account of local 
conditions. </P>
<P>All compact members must produce what the compact calls a “communication on 
progress”, essentially an accountability measure to demonstrate how they are 
adhering to the ten principles. </P>
<P>Local networks are also encouraged to be multi-stakeholder and encompass 
civil society groups as well as business. The UN Development Programme helps out 
where it can with local networks in poorer nations, particularly in Africa. </P>
<H2>Making the principles part of organisational change </H2>
<P>When it comes to levels of engagement with the ten principles by existing 
members, “obviously we have leaders and laggards”, says Kell. Signatories 
defined as “non-communicators” and “inactive participants” by the compact are 
publicly listed as such. This is what Kell calls “exercising pressure, a little 
bit of the stick”. </P>
<P>Local networks use peer reviews of each other’s work to judge progress, Kell 
says, and one of the objectives of local networks is to work collectively 
together, particularly on areas such as corruption, which can sometimes only be 
tackled by group action in a particular region or country. </P>
<P>The area of laggard member accountability has been one of the major areas of 
complaints by NGOs about the compact. Groups such as Oxfam have complained that 
some companies do much less than others and that a tougher line is needed. T</P>
<P>he compact’s approach now seems to be something of a compromise between 
FTSE4Good’s approach – the ethical index announces who has failed to make enough 
changes to stay in its index – and the compact’s original need to build up 
members before gently applying pressure to drive progress. </P>
<P>Kell says that dialogue with NGO critics of the compact “has improved 
significantly” in the past few years. He describes the past few years as 
revealing some important trends, one being that the debate over voluntarism 
versus regulation may be maturing a little. </P>
<P>“I think it is increasingly understood that voluntary initiatives are not a 
substitute for regulation but a complement. You need both in the real world. 
Different situations need different approaches … understanding about that 
finally seems to be sinking in.</P>
<P>“However, I wouldn’t rule out a new wave of backlash in a year or two, these 
things seem to move in cycles.” A change in the US administration, he points 
out, may mean a refocus on the corporate world from NGOs and politicians. </P>
<H2>Institution building</H2>
<P>When it comes to business environments in developing nations and local 
standards and law enforcement, a common complaint from companies is that 
governments, nationally and locally, often lack both capacity and will to 
enforce their laws. </P>
<P>Kell agrees that companies have a role to play in helping build civil society 
and governmental capacity outside the NGO sector in such nations. “I think it’s 
unavoidable,” he says. A company has a responsibility, he says, to “contribute 
to more robust public institutions”. </P>
<P>Business has taken a cautious course in this area since the political turmoil 
of the 1970s, says Kell. “In today’s new world order, business has long gone 
global and governments have remained local. Some governments do not have the 
capacity or the will to act in the best interests of their people. Business has 
to demonstrate greater engagement in building more robust, stable and fair 
policy frameworks. It is unavoidable.” </P>
<H2><BR>Growth strongest in emerging economies</H2>
<P>The Compact already has 3,200 participants from 93 countries, 110 of which 
are S&amp;P global 500 companies and 1,000 “very large corporations”. Thirty per 
cent of members are small and medium-sized enterprises. </P>
<P>Growth is currently greater in developing countries. Four to five hundred 
other participants are made up mostly of NGOs, some universities and a few city 
authorities. About half of Global Compact participants are from outside the 
OECD. </P>
<H3><BR>Kell on Paul Wolfowitz, president of the World Bank: 
</H3>
<P>“We could be in for a positive surprise. The drive on anti-corruption is a 
welcome one. If there is a commitment to come up with a fair and a credible 
approach across the board and not politicise the issue, we all stand to 
benefit…If governments fail, markets cannot succeed.”</P>
<P>“Asking business to come clean on corruption while society at large and 
public institutions fail to do so is not only not fair, it does not tackle the 
root cause of the problem.”</P>
<H3><BR>On the financial markets and corporate citizenship 
demands:</H3>
<P>The UN’s principles for responsible investment in public pension funds were 
launched in Paris and New York at the end of April. By early May institutional 
investors controlling more than $4 trillion in assets had signed up to the 
principles. The financial markets are vital to the future of better corporate 
citizenship, says Kell: “They are the decisive factor”.</P>
<P>They “forge a much-needed link between corporate responsibility and 
decision-making in the financial markets”, says Kell. “Long-term investors are 
now recognising that in an inter-dependent world the price-risk analysis is 
changing, and unless and until organisations internalise sound principles in 
their own organisations they are not well prepared to manage risks and 
opportunities. Financial markets are now adjusting their risk paradigms to take 
this into account.” </P>
<P>Kell considers the launch events as historic; the principles state that 
environmental, social and governance issues “in today’s inter-dependent world”, 
as Kell puts it, are “increasingly important for long-term viability of 
enterprises”. Therefore long-term investors, he says, are taking these factors 
into account through research and preference setting. “It will fundamentally 
help to establish the business case,” he says. </P>
<H3><BR>On corporate social responsibility standards: </H3>
<P>It’s a complex area, says Kell. “Over time the field will sort itself out.” 
For Kell, what’s important for corporate social responsibility standards to 
deliver is “process, performance indicators that allow credible and material 
communication on changes made over time”. </P>
<P>The field of corporate citizenship is “moving away from end of the pipe 
measurements” like some of the investment and benchmarking schemes, and is now 
more about positive screening than negative screening (where ethical funds seek 
to engage companies rather than simply counting them out by industry). “The 
financial markets will ultimately have the final say in terms of what will 
emerge in the market place”.</P>
<H3><BR>On Sudan and the current divestment campaign:</H3>
<P>“It’s a huge dilemma”. Some of the Global Compact members have said they want 
to form a campaign to pressure governments to do more on tackling the genocide 
in Sudan, he says. “I’m always reluctant to advocate a divestment approach. I 
have yet to be convinced that divestment has ever really worked.” </P>
<P>Studies that have looked at the divestment campaigns that took place with 
regard to South Africa have shown that companies that implemented the right 
policies on the ground and stayed, “have probably contributed more to a peaceful 
transformation than those who left”. </P>
<H3><BR>Kell’s tips for chief executives:</H3>
<P>“If you want to become a leader in this field you really have to practise 
what you preach at the top, building transparency, accountability and sound 
ethics into your operations globally.” </P>
<P>Chief executives must have strict incentives in place, make sure the culture 
of the company lives the values of the firm and Kell says “redesign your whole 
incentive structure” so that corporate responsibility becomes a board issue of 
strategic significance. “This is so fundamental to long-term value creation.” 
</P>
<P>In order to achieve this, argues Kell, a chief executive must really be 
willing to “push it down the line into the last outreach of the supply chain”. 
“This requires turning corporations into learning organisations which come to 
grips with the imperatives of the 21st Century.” </P>
<H3><BR>On internalising the ten principles within the 
United Nations itself: </H3>
<P>The UN pension fund has also signed up the newly launched principles for 
responsible investment. “It took us two years to make the case … the next order 
of the day is to get our procurement fully in sync with the Global Compact. 
These kinds of organisational change issues are really tough; this is one step 
in a long change process.</P>
<P>“My dream is to make the United Nations the most transparent of all public 
institutions and to make it as accountable as possible; we need to set an 
example.” </P>
<P>The compact has recently published a report called Business UNusual, looking 
at what it can learn from companies about how to reform the UN and better reward 
performance. </P>
<H3><BR>On the value of Global Compact local networks:</H3>
<P>“Usually, companies start off by doing little partnership projects with an 
NGO or with one other company. Increasingly, local networks act as catalysts to 
bring together a larger number of like-minded companies together to work more on 
the systemic change issues.” </P>
<H3><BR>On anti-corruption in countries such as Argentina, 
Bulgaria and Malawi:</H3>
<P>“It’s not enough if just business takes steps. We also need to bring on board 
public institutions, hence the idea of collective action. The idea of a local 
network, with public institutions working together, is increasingly gaining 
momentum. </P>
<P>“The more general challenge is how to combine global advocacy with local 
action. </P>
<P>“We are experimenting with a number of models. We don’t know which works 
best, but we do know you need buy in at the local level but we also know that a 
global authority and push can help sometimes to kick start something. </P>
<H3><BR>On organising a local network in China, where the 
government is institutionally biased against organised groups:</H3>
<P>“China is a special case. We have decided to focus more on the broad-based 
educational efforts and institutions that have the capacity to work towards 
large-scale change. In part the CEC, the China Enterprise Confederation, is 
working on a large scale with the compact to translate documents and hold 
workshops. We are betting on a long-term educational effort. CEOs of companies 
like TLC and Conoco really seem to get the message and have made very bold moves 
and statements [on corporate citizenship].”</P>
<H3><BR>On companies saying that the compact just puts a 
badge on what they do already:</H3>
<P>“It doesn’t matter at all. We are proud to act as accelerators and 
facilitators and re-enforcers.” The recent McKinsey study on the impact of the 
compact found that the compact gave companies connections to other companies to 
share learning on the ten principles. “In many markets the compact is de facto 
the first initiative of this kind to bring on board champions in emerging 
economies.”</P>
<H3><BR>Others on the Global Compact: </H3>
<P>“We believe the Global Compact has the potential to contribute positively to 
sustainable development. At the micro level, the GC can provide legitimacy and 
strength to CSR departments in the member company. At the macro level, the GC 
can create a greater understanding in the business community of the need for 
increased corporate accountability … </P>
<P>"If the Global Compact is to contribute to sustainable development, the 
limits of voluntary initiatives should not be under-communicated within the 
Global Compact, neither should the secretariat use its agenda-setting and 
legitimising power to define corporate responsibility as a strictly voluntary 
matter. Sustainable development is not that easily achieved.” </P>
