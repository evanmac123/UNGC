<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>The international economic order constructed by the West after World War II 
reflected a highly advantageous configuration of factors that produced a 
generation of sustained economic expansion. The world distribution of economic 
power favored an open and non-discriminatory approach to organizing 
international economic relations. There was broad ideological consensus 
regarding the role of the state in ensuring domestic employment, price stability 
and social safety nets. A commensurate body of economic analysis and policy 
prescriptions existed that enabled the state to act on these preferences. The 
major corporate actors were national in scope and international economic 
relations largely comprised arms-length transactions among separate and distinct 
national economies. As a result, point-of-entry barriers to economic 
transactions constituted meaningful tools of economic policy. The prevailing 
form of nationalism was the civic not ethnic kind, which facilitated 
international economic cooperation and, in the case of Western Europe, the 
process of supranational integration. A set of international organizations was 
put in place that expressed and supported the postwar compromise of embedded 
liberalism, as it has been called (Ruggie, 1982), most importantly the Bretton 
Woods institutions, the GATT and the United Nations</P>
<P>Much has changed in the past half century to erode the efficacy of this set 
of understandings and arrangements. However, no factor has been as consequential 
as the expanding and intensifying process of globalization (Ruggie, 1996). At 
bottom, globalization has increasingly disconnected one single element – 
networks of production and finance – from what had been an overall system of 
institutional relations, and sent it off on its own spatial and temporal 
trajectory. This has produced two disequillibria in the world political economy, 
which will persist unless and until the strictly economic sphere is embedded 
once more in broader frameworks of shared values and institutionalized 
practices.</P>
<P>The first is between the strictly economic sphere, and the broader frameworks 
of shared values and practices within which the economic sphere has been 
embedded at the national level. The second imbalance is in international 
governance structures. There has been a significant expansion of global economic 
rule making over the past decade. But it has been aimed largely at creating the 
institutional bases for the functioning of global markets. The rights of global 
corporate actors have been secured, for example, and considerable efforts have 
gone into the creation of corresponding rules for the global trading regime – 
such as TRIPS and TRIMS. These rules have been codified and means provided for 
their enforcement. But these expressions of rule-making have not been matched by 
comparable efforts on behalf of other global concerns, such as the environment, 
human rights or poverty or for that matter food safety and international 
cartels. In fact, in some instances, previous commitments in these areas have 
been weakened – e.g., ODA. For example, Official Development Assistance (ODA) 
from Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Member countries fell by 21% from 
1992 to 1997; as a proportion of their combined national income, it fell by 
one-third. These are the largest declines since the inception of the DAC in 1961 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1999).</P>
<P>The major capitalist countries have the domestic and institutional capacity 
to protect themselves from the worst negative effects of this imbalance. But the 
rest of the world is far more vulnerable, and this vulnerability has been 
exacerbated by the neo-liberal orthodoxies the so-called Washington consensus. 
Large parts of Africa have become economically marginalized.</P>
<P>Our reading of history suggests that imbalances of this sort are not long 
sustainable.<BR>Indeed, the embedded liberalism compromise itself was an 
innovative response to precisely these kinds of imbalances at the national 
level, which had caused the system to blow up in the 1930's.</P>
<P>A key challenge for the international community, therefore, is to devise for 
the global economy the kind of institutional equilibrium that existed in the 
postwar international economic order. Calls for a new Bretton Woods or for a new 
economic architecture reflect this quest, although they show little sign of 
significant progress. We focus here on the longer-term interplay between two 
sets of key actors in the global economy, transnational corporations (TNCs) and 
transnational Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), and we do so from the 
institutional venue of the United Nations. NGOs are broadly defined here as any 
non-profit voluntary citizens group that is constituted at the local, national 
or international level.</P>
<P>Civil society actors are increasingly targeting TNCs and the trading system 
as leverage by means of which to pursue broader social and environmental 
concerns. We contend that this dynamic interplay provides great potential for 
attempts to bridge the imbalance between economic globalization and the 
governance structures that it has left behind.</P>
<P>One modest instance of this claim is the global Compact initiated by United 
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the Davos World Economic Forum in 
January 1999 challenging the international business community to help the United 
Nations implement universal values in the areas of human rights, environment and 
labor. See <A 
href="http://www.un.org/partners/business">www.un.org/partners/business</A> The 
initiative has been well received by the corporate community and, at minimum, 
gives added momentum to the growing recognition that markets require shared 
values and institutionalized practices if they are to survive and thrive. In 
this chapter, we first describe briefly the component parts of the global 
compact; we then offer an account of its positive reception; and finally we draw 
some conclusions from the case.</P>
<H2>THE GLOBAL COMPACT</H2>
<P>The Global Compact challenges individual corporations and representative 
business associations to demonstrate good global corporate citizenship by 
embracing nine principles in the areas of environment, labor and human rights, 
and by advocating for stronger United Nations organizations in those and related 
areas. The nine principles are derived from the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), the Rio Declaration of the United Nations Conference of 
Environment and Development (UNCED) held in 1992, and the four fundamental 
principles and rights at work adopted at the World Economic and Social Summit 
(WESS) in Copenhagen in 1997 and reaffirmed by the ILO in 1999. The areas and 
principles chosen are those that are most relevant at the corporate level and at 
the global rule making level, while at the same time rooted in solid 
international commitments and even treaty obligations. The ILO, OCHR and UNEP 
are partner agencies within the UN itself.</P>
<P>The Compact is pitched at both the micro and the macro-level. While 
recognizing that governments have the main responsibility for implementing 
universal values, a novel feature of the Compact is that corporations are asked 
to embrace these values directly, in their own sphere of operation. 
Specifically, they are asked to incorporate them into their mission statements 
and to translate them into concrete corporate management practices.<BR>A key 
tool to facilitate the adoption, implementation and dissemination of these 
commitments is a web site (<A 
href="http://www.un.org/partners/business/globcomp.htm">www.un.org/partners/business/globcomp.htm</A> 
) constructed with the help of corporations, business associations, the partner 
agencies and NGO's. The website showcases good corporate practices and 
eventually best practices and it features commentaries by NGO's.</P>
<P>The Global Compact is not designed as a code of conduct. Instead, it is meant 
to serve as a framework of reference and dialogue to stimulate best practices 
and to bring about convergence in corporate practices around universally shared 
values. Of course, it is possible for the Compact to evolve into an instrument 
of greater precision if and as conditions warrant.</P>
<P>Challenging TNCs in particular to become good corporate citizens that accept 
responsibility commensurate with the power and rights they enjoy ensures that 
corporations from developing countries are not punished for lacking the capacity 
to behave in the same way (Bhagwatti, 1998). At the macro-level, or the level of 
global rule making, the Global Compact tries to enlist the business community in 
an advocacy role on behalf of UN. At the global rule-making level, a 
significantly strengthened United Nations in terms of authority and resources 
would fill an important governance gap that has been the source of tension and 
has threatened to undermine multilateralism, as was witnessed at the Third 
Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in December 1999. A United 
Nations capable of effectively addressing environmental, labor and human rights 
concerns, in short, would also help ensure a sustained commitment to the global 
trade regime.</P>
<P>There are positive indications that the international business community is 
responding to the challenge. The ICC on 5 July 1999, adopted a statement arguing 
for a stronger UN as the most sensible way forward. The ICC also pledged to work 
with UN agencies to implement the Global Compact at the corporate level. The ICC 
has already endorsed the notion that a stronger UN in the areas of labor, human 
rights and the environment is the most sensible way forward to secure open 
markets. Individual corporations have lent their support and have assisted in 
the construction of the website, as have leading ngo's in the areas covered by 
the Compact.</P>
<P>If the Global Compact were to succeed, it would have accomplished two things. 
The United Nations would have enlisted the corporate sector to help close the 
gap between the strictly economic sphere and the broader social agendas that 
exists at the global level today: which the corporate sector itself created. The 
UN would have gained corporate backing for a more robust UN role in human 
rights, environment and labor standards, thereby responding to imbalance in 
global governance structures mentioned above.</P>
<P>On the side of the business community, success will depend in no small 
measure on the capacity of global business associations to mobilize sufficient 
advocacy support for strengthening global governance structures in the 
environment, development, human rights and labor. Only business associations can 
circumvent the collective action problems faced by individual firms. In the 
absence of aggregate corporate representation, collective responsibilities can 
neither be formulated nor implemented. The international community should have a 
keen interest in promoting representative business associations.</P>
<P>At the corporate level, the question is whether a sufficient critical number 
of moral first movers will articulate a commitment to embrace social 
responsibilities, and whether they have the power to establish dominant 
industry-wide corporate social purposes. A closely related question is whether 
TNCs will continue to respond to multiple pressures on an ad-hoc basis or 
whether their response will converge around universal values. The plethora of 
voluntary initiatives and codes, including labeling schemes, that have emerged 
over the past years at the corporate, sectoral and national level have several 
shortcomings: they are selective in content due to the absence of uniform 
definitions; many lack transparency and provide for inadequate representation of 
their supposed beneficiaries; and it is not clear to whom they are accountable. 
See ILO (1999b) for a comprehensive overview. As these shortcomings become 
apparent, pressure for arrangements based on more stable global platforms may 
increase.</P>
<P>The answer to these questions has a great deal to do with how the dynamic 
tension that exists today between TNCs and NGOs is played out. We turn now to 
that subject.</P>
<H2>THE DYNAMICS OF CHANGE</H2>
<P>The relationship between market and society at the global level is slowly 
being reshaped. The main protagonists are TNCs, and NGOs. And the struggle 
involves two complementary sets of concerns. First, it is a struggle over 
prevailing social expectations about the role of corporations, especially large 
TNCs: is the business of business merely business, or is it something more? 
Second, it is a struggle over the global trade regime, specifically the extent 
to which it should accommodate a variety of social agendas. Human rights, labor 
standards and the environment feature prominently in both instances. Let us take 
a brief look at the two sets of actors and the issues at stake.</P>
<P>The rise of TNCs in the wake of lower barriers to trade and investment has 
been widely documented. FDI flows have steadily increased over the past decades, 
both in absolute terms and in relation to trade and output. The activities of 
TNCs have also become more truly transnational as the share of employment, 
turnover and profit generated in foreign markets has grown. Since 1990, the 
average transnationality index of the top 100 TNCs has increased from 51% to 
55%, largely a result of the growing internationalization of assets especially 
between 1993 and 1996. At the same time, TNC strategies to take advantage of 
broadened market access have generated new approaches to integrated 
manufacturing networks and marketing strategies that put a premium on global 
image and branding.</P>
<P>The role of NGOs in the international arena has only recently attracted 
serious attention and is not yet well understood. NGOs have long been active in 
international affairs, including at the United Nations (Kane, 1998). However, in 
recent years their impact has significantly expanded. With the award of the 1997 
Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines came widespread 
acknowledgment of their growing political influence. Their subsequent role in 
bringing to a halt the OECD sponsored negotiations on a Multilateral Agreement 
on Investment (MAI) was further evidence of their powers of persuasion 
(Henderson, 1999).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of NGOs has much to do with their ability to use the 
Internet to tap into broader social movements and gain media attention. Relying 
on hi-tech, low-cost means of grassroots advocacy around single issues, they 
have demonstrated the effectiveness of decentralized and flexible structures 
combined with non-formalized communication and decision making. See Peter Wahl 
on <A 
href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/ngos/wahl.htm">www.globalpolicy.org/ngos/wahl.htm</A> 
for a good review of recent trends. Also see Abe Katz, chairman of the US 
Business Council, who devoted his farewell speech to the issue of how NGOs are 
using the Internet to slow down liberalization (Lucetini, 1998). Some NGOs have 
transnationalized their structures, in a manner comparable to TNCs. In 
particular, environmental NGOs such as WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and Greenpeace, 
but also AI (Amnesty International), Human Rights Watch and many others.</P>
<H3>Corporate Social Responsibility</H3>
<P>The changing relationship between society and the corporate community is 
illustrated by prevailing expectations about corporate social responsibility CSR 
can be understood as the conditions under which society grants private 
corporations the right to pursue the maximization of profits. This social 
contract between a corporation and its host society implies legal requirements 
or can be understood to include implicit assumptions and expectations. See 
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 1999) for a good 
overview of the social responsibility of TNCs. (CSR) (Friedman, 1984; Donaldson 
and Dunfee, 1994). While the use of stakeholder pressure to influence the 
behavior of corporations is as old as business itself, the meaning of CSR has 
changed dramatically over the past decade. As recently as 1990, the interaction 
between business and society remained largely confined to local or national 
scenes, and the conventional view that the major responsibility of business is 
to produce goods and services and to sell them for a profit was not seriously 
questioned.</P>
<P>As liberalization has expanded business opportunities and generated global 
corporate networks, the bargaining balance in many societies has shifted in 
favor of the private sector, and in developing countries particularly to TNCs. 
Sales of leading TNCs exceed GDP of regional giants such as Thailand and South 
Africa (UNDP, 1999, p. 32). But this shift, in turn, has provoked attempts by 
civil society actors and others to orchestrate counter-measures. Unlike the 
static responses triggered by the first wave of significant transnationalization 
of the in the early 1970s, however, today's countervailing movements have 
focussed on the social responsibility of corporations, and on ways to alter 
corporate behavior through public exposure. Effective use of communications 
technology and the willingness of the international media to carry stories about 
corporate misdeeds has greatly increased public focus on corporations. These 
groups have targeted ("naming and shaming") high-profile corporations such as 
Nike, Shell and Rio Tinto.</P>
<P>The interaction between NGOs and TNCs around the issue of CSR is highly 
dynamic and evolving rapidly. For a good discussion forum see <A 
href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/business-ngo-relations/">www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/business-ngo-relations/</A> But 
two distinct approaches are taking shape (Sethi, 1994b). At one end of the 
spectrum, numerous NGOs continue to pursue confrontational approaches, applying 
a wide range of campaign tools such as provocation, consumer boycotts, 
litigation and direct protest (Cramb, 1999). At the other end, a growing number 
of NGOs including the most transnational, such as Amnesty International, Human 
Rights Watch, WWF and others, have entered strategic partnerships with TNCs, 
recognizing that corporate change leaders can become effective role models or 
advocates for broader societal concerns.</P>
<P>These partnerships are in an early stage of development, and they are often 
sponsored by a neutral broker such as a government agency or business NGO. 
Examples include the U.K. ethical trading initiative, the development of 
national ethics codes in Canada and Norway and the work of the World Bank on 
best practices in the extracting industry. Many other initiatives are sponsored 
by business NGOs such as the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development) and the PWBLF (Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum). Some TNCs 
are developing 'stakeholder policies', thus trying to cope with the increasing 
influence and business-orientation of NGOs. These novel forms of business-NGO 
dialogue have already brought about significant changes in selected areas, 
especially corporate environmental practices. It remains to be seen whether 
these experiments will evolve into lasting structures for bridging social and 
business interests.</P>
<P>Corporations, on the other hand, have had to learn that globalization 
strategies, particularly global branding, have created not only new 
opportunities but also vulnerabilities (Wild 1998). Large corporations no longer 
advertise their products by the country of origin ( e.g. "made in Japan") but 
establish global brand names and corporate images. These intangible assets have 
become important in establishing a global presence and by some estimate make up 
as much as 40% of the market value of corporations. Protecting image and brand 
names has quickly evolved as a major challenge that had to be met if 
globalization strategies were to succeed.</P>
<P>The need to protect the corporate image has fostered an array of corporate 
responses, ranging from private sector initiatives at the firm and industry 
level, to private/public partnership approaches, as well as a renewed interest 
in regional and international sectoral initiatives (ILO, 1999a). Depending on 
their vulnerability towards public scrutiny together with the environment and 
the degree of exposure in which they operate, a few TNCs have publicly broken 
rank with conventional views and embraced concerns for human rights, the 
environment and labor in their mission statements, management practices and 
annual reporting BP and Shell, two front-runners in this movement, caused 
considerable bewilderment in the business community when they included human 
rights and sustainable development on their annual report. (Cramb and Corzine, 
1998).</P>
<P>Transnationals are subject not only to external pressure but also to internal 
needs. Many have begun to confront the challenge of how to integrate into one 
global corporate culture the increasing number of diverse national cultures of 
their officers and employees. Success or failure can have a direct impact on the 
bottom line. The corporate interest in business ethics and good citizenship is, 
in part, a reflection of this concern. In essence, corporations that take 
transnationalization seriously in corporate staffing and governance have slowly 
moved toward the articulation of ever broader sets of values, which are not 
otherwise essential to contracting or market functioning, in the attempt to 
define the cultural bonds that hold the company together (The Conference Board, 
1999; Environics International Ltd et. al, 1999).</P>
<P>The corporate propensity to respond to civil society concerns and the degree 
to which these responses are internalized in corporate practices also depends on 
their market power. Only under conditions of imperfect markets can individual 
executives afford to guide corporations toward greater ethical norms (Sethi, 
1994a).</P>
<P>Overall TNC responses remain highly uneven. While a small but growing number 
have taken a public stand on ethical issues, it is unclear whether this is a 
temporary experiment that remains limited to a relatively small number of 
leading global corporations - mostly active in consumer products and natural 
resources - or whether it heralds a dominant future trend. Even where innovative 
responses have been taken, corporations show varying degrees of translating good 
will declarations into actual management practices, corporate performance and 
reporting (Watts, 1998).</P>
<H3>The Trade Debate</H3>
<P>At the global rule-making level, the relationship between trade, on the one 
hand, and social, environmental or human rights issues on the other, has emerged 
as a flash-point of controversy between commercial interests and civil society 
groups, mostly of developed countries – as the whole world saw at Seattle. Over 
the past few decades, successive waves of lower trade and investment barriers 
have made very apparent the effects of different national policies. Calls for a 
level playing field and for minimum standards to avoid a race to the bottom have 
become louder and varying coalitions have been formed to pressure governments to 
use trade as a means to enforce higher standards or directly change the trading 
rules to accommodate social agendas.</P>
<P>Those who oppose linking trade with other concerns have argued that this 
would put too much stress on the trading system, thereby rendering it 
ineffective; and that it would not solve the problems at hand because the 
trading system is not designed to solve labor, environmental and human rights 
issues. Moreover, opponents are deeply concerned that seeking to impose such 
standards through the trade regime would be an open invitation to exploit them 
for protectionist purposes, to the grave disadvantages of the developing 
countries and the trade regime as a whole. Instead, developing countries argue, 
higher standards in areas such as environment can only be achieved through the 
process of accumulating skills, capital and technology. Higher standards in 
areas such as the environment cannot be imposed, they argue but can only be 
achieved through an incremental process of accumulating skills, capital and 
technology.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the views of developing countries are increasingly converging 
with those of TNCs - and outward oriented corporations of any size, forming a 
potentially powerful policy coalition that has not yet been fully realized. This 
is evident when comparing policy statements of the International Chamber of 
Commerce and of developing countries. The convergence has gradually proceeded 
over the past few years, to a point where positions are sometimes virtually 
indistinguishable.</P>
<P>The conflict over trade rules was evident in the debates following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round. A compromise declaration was reached at the 
first WTO Ministerial meeting in December 1996, where it was confirmed that the 
ILO was the competent body to deal with labor issues, and where a decision was 
taken to keep environmental issues merely under review within the WTO framework. 
This was only a temporary lull, however. As preparations for the Third 
Ministerial Meeting of the WTO gained momentum, conflicts around these issues 
became more intense again.17 Large demonstrations in Geneva in 1998 showed that 
the WTO and big business have become a target of social movements of all 
sorts.</P>
<P>As pressure by civil society actors has intensified, various attempts have 
been made to appease their concerns by increasing the transparency of the WTO 
and by searching for compromises. A dialogue forum on development and the 
environment was held in March, see <A 
href="http://www.wto.org/wto/index.htm">http://www.wto.org/wto/index.htm</A>, 
and of arrangements have been made that allows NGOs to attend some debates. 
President Clinton, for example, proposed in an ILO speech to "build a link" with 
labor (Clinton, 1999). Renato Ruggiero, as Director General of the WTO, stressed 
the need for balancing global governance structures, culminating in his proposal 
for a World Environment Organization (Ruggiero, 1999).</P>
<P>The Third Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in Seattle in early December 1999 
thrust civil society movements into the public consciousness. Their common 
denominator was the use of trade to advance a host of other issues. With 30,000 
protesters and about 20,000 labor union members marching in the street, the 
Seattle event demonstrated vividly how trade and large corporations have become 
the target of citizen's groups.</P>
<P>The collapse of the Seattle talks and the failure to agree on another round 
of trade liberalization was not the result of pressure from the street however. 
The talks had to be suspended because trade negotiators failed to bridge 
conflicting views, especially in the area of agriculture where the EU tried hard 
to deflect pressure to reduce farm subsidies. Yet, the demonstrations and the 
movements preceding them, especially in the U.S, had their impact. In an 
interview after the Seattle talks, the European Union's trade commissioner 
Pascal Lamy went on record by blaming the collapse of the Seattle talks on the 
pressure of looming US presidential elections and President Clinton's call in 
Seattle for labor standards to be included in trade agreements19 See N. Buckley 
(1999, Dec. 7) Collapse of Seattle talks blamed on US. The Financial Times. . In 
the same vein, India's chief representative at Seattle said that President 
Clinton's remark about labor standards "made all the developing countries and 
least-developed countries harden their views. It created such a furor that they 
all felt the danger ahead".20 Reported by Celia W. Dugger(1999, Dec. 17) Why 
India and Others See U.S. as Villain on Trade, New York Times</P>
<P>The Seattle experience showed that civil society groups are increasingly 
powerful at the corporate, national and international levels and that 
inter-governmental organizations such as the WTO have yet to learn how to 
respond. The fact that over 90% of the NGOs that attended the Third Ministerial 
Meeting in Seattle came from OECD countries indicates a strong northern bias. 
The voices of the people of the developing countries' remain unheard, and in 
those cases where developing countries' NGOs do participate they are often 
subsidiaries of NGOs hosted in OECD countries.</P>
<P>The Seattle meeting confirmed once again that opponents of trade 
liberalization represent highly heterogeneous groups with different motivations. 
The spectrum of protesters included a small anarchist minority, a large number 
of single issue groups concerned with the environment, health and human rights, 
trade unions who fear that structural adjustments due to market openness are not 
offset by positive effects of increased competition, and powerful economic 
interests that seek government protection in areas such as steel and 
textiles.</P>
<P>Numerous activists took up the call to rally against exploitation and 
environmental destruction in developing countries, while at the same time 
ignoring the basic fact that trade remains the most viable path to escape 
poverty and that developed countries continue denying poor countries market 
access in areas where they stand a chance to compete. Protesters readily took up 
the slogans of the A.F.L – I.C.O. but were apparently not influenced by 
development oriented NGOs who understand that poverty is the main cause of child 
labor and environmental destruction in poor economies and that trade and 
investment have overall a positive and mutually reinforcing consequences for 
human rights, development and the environment. This apparent hypocrisy led many 
observers and commentators refer to developing countries as the real losers of 
Seattle.</P>
<P>What the debate on CSR and trade have in common</P>
<P>The interaction between TNCs and NGOs at the corporate level and the 
controversies around global trade reveal a number of consequential 
tendencies.</P>
<P>First, contrary to conflicts between markets and society during the 1960s and 
1970s<BR>-- for example, the controversial debates around the UN Code of Conduct 
for TNCs – the issue at stake today is not in the main ideological. Opponents of 
globalization do not advocate an alternative ideology. While they seem united in 
their intention to oppose markets, most of them thrive because of economic good 
times and their operations and networking hinge critically on the free access to 
information technology.</P>
<P>Indeed, most transnational NGOs take positions against TNCs and trade not 
because they inherently oppose their legitimacy or functional efficacy. They do 
so primarily because it promises to leverage their own specific interests and 
concerns. This strategic positioning is greatly facilitated by the fact that the 
trade regime is not static in its relation to society, nor does it represent a 
concrete thing. The trade regime is intersubjective in character and reflects 
the shared meanings and understandings attributed to it by the relevant actors 
(Ruggie, 1998). As a result, issues can always be characterized in more than one 
way. In situations of choice, the act of characterization itself can be 
strategic in the sense that the actors select a characterization not on the 
basis of objective facts but on the positional implications of one formulation 
over the other (Wolfe, 1999).</P>
<P>If such strategic positioning is a central feature of current debates this 
carries considerable risks, especially in circumstances where it overlaps with 
real economic interests in protection - seeking industries or other interests. 
The most likely losers are those that are not party to the game - consumers 
everywhere and developing countries in particular.</P>
<P>However, while environmental and human rights NGOs may be motivated 
strategically in the debates around trade and TNCs, their position is given 
added moral weight by the imbalance in current global governance structures. 
There is a stark contrast between the available institutional mechanisms to 
define and enforce global rules that advance the economic interests of TNCs and 
the under-funded and relatively weak UN agencies charged with advancing the 
causes of the environment, development, human rights and labor. And at the 
United Nations, there is a wide gap between the ambitious goals and broad 
commitments embodied in various United Nations conferences on social issues and 
the degree to which governments are willing to honor such commitments. The 
follow-up process to UNCED exemplifies this trend. Indications are that 
"Copenhagen +5" will be comparably sobering.</P>
<P>Finally, there are some signs that elements in the global corporate community 
are themselves increasingly concerned by the unsustainability of the current 
imbalance in global governance structures, recognizing that global markets no 
less than national ones need to be embedded in broader frameworks of social 
values and practices if they are to survive and thrive (ICC 1998a, 1998b, 1999) 
There is an interesting difference between the financial community, especially 
Wall Street, which continues to oppose any regulation of global markets, and 
corporations that actually invest long-term productive capital. The rift became 
obvious during the peak of the Asian Financial crisis, with the latter warning 
about the need for at least some regulation of financial markets. . As a result, 
they have begun to look to the United Nations to play a larger role in setting 
norms and standards that express not merely the functional values of direct 
interest to business, but also broader global social issues. At Seattle, Kofi 
Annan invited participants to view the United Nations as a part of the solution 
to the problem with which they were grappling (Annan, 1999).</P>
<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>Globalization may be a fact of life, but it remains highly fragile. Embedding 
global market forces in shared values and institutionalized practices, and 
bridging the gaps in global governance structures are among the most important 
challenges faced by policymakers and corporate leaders alike. The future of 
globalization may hang in the balance. This challenge has to be met at the 
micro-level, where we believe the move toward articulating and acting upon 
universal values offers a viable approach. And it has to be solved at the level 
of global rule-making, where we believe strengthening the role of the United 
Nations has a productive role to play. The Global Compact is intended as a 
contribution to both though by its ver nature and scope, it can only make a 
modest contribution. Let us draw some conclusions from the case.</P>
<P>One can readily appreciate why corporations would be attracted to the Global 
Compact. It offers one stop-shopping in the three critical areas of greatest 
external pressure: human rights, environment and labor standards, thereby 
reducing their transaction costs. It offers the legitimacy of having 
corporations sign off onto something sponsored by the Secretary-General – and, 
far more important, the legitimacy of acting on universally agreed to principles 
that are enshrined in covenants and declarations. And, the corporate sector is 
fears that the trade regime will become saddled with environmental and social 
standards and collapse under their weight; in comparison, a stronger UN in these 
areas is far preferable.</P>
<P>The NGO community is divided over the approach. The smaller and/or more 
radical single issue ngo's believe that the United Nations has entered into a 
Faustian bargain at best. But the larger and more transnationalized NGOs have 
concluded that a strategy of "constructive engagement" will yield better results 
than confrontation, and they are cooperating with the United Nations. At the 
same time, it is no doubt true that without the threat of confrontation, 
engagement would be less likely to succeed. The developing countries have yet to 
take a position. They fully support efforts to keep the trade regime free of 
additional conditionalities and barriers. But they are also worried that working 
with TNCs to improve their practices could become a Trojan Horse to put pressure 
on the governments of those countries. And if we succeed in our endeavor, the 
imbalance in global governance structures will be somewhat attenuated.</P>
<P>The experience of working together on the Global Compact has also brought 
greater coherence to the United Nations entities active in this domain, and the 
hope that connected behavior accomplishes far more than fragmented action. Thus, 
the Global Compact may signal that the United Nations may become a more salient 
player in the post-Seattle game of forging new instruments through which to 
manage the consequences of globalization.</P>
