<H2>Global Compact Dialogue on the Role of the Private Sector in 
Zones of Conflict<BR>Palais Wilson, 27 September 2001</H2>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>It is a pleasure for me to welcome you all to the Palais Wilson for this 
second Global Compact dialogue on the role of the private sector in zones of 
conflict.</P>
<P>I think all of us here must be feeling that the agenda for the next two days 
has taken on added importance given the events of 11 September. I certainly do. 
I visited New York last week and went to see "Ground Zero". I also met with 
rescue workers and social service providers caring for victims and family 
members. So many people have been impacted by the attacks on so many different 
levels:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <DIV align=left>the victims and their family members and friends, </DIV></LI><LI>
  <DIV align=left>the thousands fighting to rebuild businesses and offices 
  or simply to keep up payments on mortgages and medical bills; </DIV></LI><LI>
  <DIV align=left>the millions of people who are now struggling to return 
  to their jobs, to keep their children safe, to find a way to somehow make life 
  "normal" again; </DIV>
  </LI><LI>
  <DIV align=left>And we cannot forget those who have been subjected to acts of 
  violence and discrimination since the attacks simply because of how they 
  looked or dressed, or where they may be from.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have brought into sharper 
focus for all of us fortunate enough to live with a sense of relative security 
and safety how dramatically and completely life changes when indiscriminate 
violence and terror strike our communities. </P>
<P>11 September has been a powerful reminder of the vested interest we all have, 
as representatives of business, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and 
academic institutions in working together and with the United Nations to help 
end conflicts and to foster peaceful societies where the human rights of all 
people are guaranteed. </P>
<P>Your first meeting in March of this year began the work of deciding how best 
the Global Compact network could do just that. I know that significant progress 
has been made since then in the four substantive areas that you identified and I 
look forward to hearing about how you plan to move ahead on these issues after 
your meeting here. </P>
<P>I thought it would be useful for me to update you briefly on what has 
happened within the UN since your March meeting. As you may know, the 
Secretary-General was requested by the Security Council to prepare a series of 
reports to it on various dimensions of conflict. Each of the three reports 
submitted to date has included a section on the role of the private sector. </P>
<P>The first of these reports was released just after your first meeting in 
March and focused on the protection of civilians in armed conflict. </P>
<P>The report stressed that the United Nations and other international 
organizations must engage the private sector in a constructive dialogue by 
building creative partnerships and by working together to ensure that corporate 
operations are placed within the framework of international norms and standards 
that provide the infrastructure on which global commerce increasingly 
depends.</P>
<P>The Secretary-General encouraged the Security Council to continue 
investigating the links between illicit trade in natural resources and the 
conduct of war and to urge Member States and regional organizations to take 
appropriate measures against corporate actors, individuals and entities involved 
in illicit trafficking in natural resources and small arms that may further fuel 
conflicts. </P>
<P>He also urged governments to adopt and enforce executive and legislative 
measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from 
engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might 
result in or contribute to violations of international humanitarian and human 
rights law.</P>
<P>In a second report last June, the Secretary-General reported to the Security 
Council on the prevention of armed conflict. He made clear that primary 
responsibility for conflict prevention rests with national Governments, with 
civil society playing an important role. He called on the United Nations and the 
international community to support national efforts for conflict prevention and 
to assist in building national capacity in this field. </P>
<P>The report's recommendations also encourage the business community to adopt 
socially responsible practices that foster a climate of peace in conflict prone 
societies, help prevent and mitigate crisis situations, and contribute to 
reconstruction and reconciliation. I believe this is a good framework to keep in 
mind as our discussions progress today.</P>
<P>Finally, earlier this month the Secretary-General submitted a third report to 
the Security Council on Children and armed conflict that also provides valuable 
recommendations. For example, the report suggests that multilateral development 
banks and the corporate sector could conduct "child impact assessments" with 
regard to particular investments and projects that they may be funding in or 
near zones of conflict. The report notes that such assessments will repay their 
own costs by leading to better relations with local communities and hence more 
viable investments.</P>
<P>This report also underlines the key role that governments can play to promote 
accountability among corporate actors in conflict situations. Labeling products 
coming from conflict zones is one area where States can make a difference. 
Another involves agreements or legislation requiring the public disclosure of 
all investments, transactions or profits originating, concluding or involving 
actors based in countries experiencing armed conflict. </P>
<P>I believe all three of these reports offer valuable guidance for all of us in 
the Global Compact network as we seek to make real progress on these issues.</P>
<P>One other UN development that I wish to mention briefly is the Durban World 
Conference against Racism, which, as you know, concluded just two days before 
the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The Conference was a difficult one – it 
was bound to be – for it addressed some of the most contentious issues faced by 
every country and by the international community. Yet real progress was made. 
The Durban programme of action provides a valuable framework for follow up 
action at all levels, including by the private sector. </P>
<P>Equally important, the Conference brought together people from around the 
world committed to fighting racism, discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. You will be pleased to know that the Global Compact was well 
represented in Durban. The Secretary-General participated in a high-level 
dialogue with Global Compact participating organisations, a multi-stakeholder 
workshop looked at partnership approaches to fighting discrimination and 
fostering diversity and a panel we co-hosted with the ILO brought together trade 
union, company and UN representatives to talk about the challenges of 
implementing equal-opportunity and diversity policies within organisations. 
Information on Durban is available here in our Office and I invite you all to 
give consideration to how we can involve the Global Compact network more in 
addressing the issues of equality and non-discrimination which are central to 
the prevention of conflict.</P>
<P>What do we hope to accomplish over the next two days? </P>
<P>My hope is that we will evaluate progress made on all topics, providing input 
on both substance and structure. But equally important, that we will begin 
gathering ideas on how best to move this work forward. </P>
<P>How can wide-spread transparency be achieved in all dealings between 
corporations and host governments? How can we best encourage all companies to 
adopt conflict and human rights impact assessment tools? What leverages can be 
used to convince governments and companies of the benefits of revenue sharing 
agreements? How can we learn from and jointly inspire increasing numbers of 
multi-stakeholder initiatives on conflict prevention and peace building? </P>
<P>These are some of the questions for which I hope we will find answers.</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
<P>The Global Compact is about the values that unite us. The attacks two weeks 
ago were a direct challenge to these values – they were an attack on fundamental 
human rights. </P>
<P>Now is the time to make universal values stronger through our individual and 
collective actions. Now is the time to show that the network of organisations 
participating in the Global Compact is taking a stand for them and acting on 
them.</P>
<P>We have the opportunity over the next two days to make a significant 
contribution to this cause. I wish you well in your discussions.</P>
<P>Thank you</P>
