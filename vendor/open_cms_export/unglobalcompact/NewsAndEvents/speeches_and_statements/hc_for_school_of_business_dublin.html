          <H1>The High Commissioner for Human Rights Developing an Ethical Globalization: 
A role for business schools?</H1>
<H2><BR>The Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business University 
College Dublin <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Dublin, Ireland, 18 January 2002</H2>
<P>It is a pleasure to be here today at the Michael Smurfit 
Graduate School of Business, University College Dublin. I believe this is the 
first time I have had the opportunity during four and a half years in the post 
of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to interact with students 
and faculty from a school of business. I am, of course, particularly pleased to 
be able to do so here in Ireland at one of the leading business schools in 
Europe. I shall be speaking about globalization today, and where better to 
discuss that subject than Ireland, recently ranked by Foreign Policy Magazine 
and A. T. Kearney Consultants, as by far the world's most globalised economy. 
<BR>I would like to thank my friend Jerry Liston for extending the invitation to 
visit the Smurfit School. A year ago, when we ran into each other at the annual 
World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, we both had the real sense 
that Davos had become, like many other international gatherings, a virtual 
prison. The multiple security clearances, armed guards and barbed wire fences 
that authorities felt were necessary to ensure the safety of participants were 
seen by many as yet another example of what was wrong with globalization. It was 
clear that we shouldn't be building more walls, we should be building more 
bridges.</P>
<P>But as you know, the protests against globalization only intensified in Genoa 
at July's G8 meeting. And some commentators have argued that the horrible events 
of 11 September were just the latest and most extreme manifestation yet of a 
growing "backlash against globalization" that will continue if the world remains 
on its present course.</P>
<P>So we would be right to ask, "where do we go from here?" Is the global 
economy an unstoppable force or does it risk collapse because of mounting 
concerns about its current path? If there are ways to change it, to make it 
benefit all people, where do we begin? What role would we expect the corporate 
sector to play given its increased power and influence in the world? What could 
all of you as students and faculty do to advance our knowledge of how business 
can ensure value for shareholders and for society? These are some of the issues 
I would hope we will be able to discuss.<BR>My message today is this - the time 
has come to move beyond the arguments for or against globalization. Our task is 
to ensure that the promise globalization holds for fostering higher standards of 
living and more open and inclusive societies are realized for all people. All 
parts of society have both a vested interest and a shared responsibility in 
working together to shape the ethical foundations of a new globalization that 
ensures respect for the human rights of all people.</P>
<P>That is also the message of an interesting book I recommend you read if you 
have not already done so. It is called An Open Letter on Globalisation – the 
Debate . The book is an initiative of the Prime Minister of Belgium, Guy 
Verhofstadt, who was President of the European Council until the end of 2001. He 
represented the European Union at Genoa and the book is a response to the 
violence there.</P>
<P>He wrote an open letter post Genoa and post 11 September to 
anti-globalization protesters. In the letter, he said that the protesters may be 
asking many of the right questions. But did they have the right answers? He 
later convened a conference in Ghent to which he invited a number of 
globalization critics and others including myself. What emerged as a consensus 
was the need for a new approach which Guy Verhofstadt termed "ethical 
globalization". It is that concept I would like to address.</P>
<H3>Towards Ethical Globalization</H3>
<P>Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his Nobel lecture, touched on the 
central challenge for the future of globalization when he reminded the 
world:</P>
<P>"No one today is unaware of this divide between the world's rich and poor. No 
one today can claim ignorance of the cost that this divide imposes on the poor 
and dispossessed who are no less deserving of human dignity, fundamental 
freedoms, security, food and education than any of us. The cost, however, is not 
borne by them alone," he added. "Ultimately, it is borne by all of us - North 
and South, rich and poor, men and women of all races and religions."</P>
<P>Building an ethical and sustainable form of globalization must begin with the 
recognition of shared responsibility for the protection of human rights. Over 50 
years ago, the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stressed 
the link between respect for human rights and freedom, justice and peace in the 
world and called for a just international and social order.</P>
<P>But let me be clear in stressing that increased cooperation along with better 
international policy and law to respond to the needs of the developing world can 
only succeed if national systems meet the test of good governance.</P>
<P>Respect for human rights remains the primary responsibility of national 
governments. Independence of the judiciary, freedom of opinion and expression, 
open and fair elections – all provide the legal framework for democracy. They 
also contribute to a healthy environment for investment and economic growth.</P>
<P>Yet the reality is that in many countries, we have seen the breakdown of 
national government institutions, weak legislative and judicial environments and 
the decline in the provision of basic services. Do we leave people in these 
countries to their own fate? Or do we accept that we have some obligation to 
make their lives better?</P>
<P>The point that is often not made clearly enough is that human rights are more 
than just good ideas or distant goals to work towards. The principles of the 
Universal Declaration have been translated into international law, in two 
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by 148 States 
and on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by 145 States. Ireland is 
among the States that are bound by these treaties.</P>
<P>Progress has been made in promoting throughout the world the idea of equal 
human rights for all. But what of the millions who suffer from deprivation of 
the basic means of life or who live under oppression and discrimination ? When 
they stand up to claim those universal rights, what are we to say to them? Let 
me offer some examples of the direction I believe we should be moving.<BR>One 
practical expression of cooperation and shared responsibility that has been 
repeatedly called for is for developed countries to halt the slide in Official 
Development Assistance and to be true development partners for the Least 
Developed Countries. I note that Ireland is making progress on ODA and is set to 
reach its interim objective of 0.45 per cent GDP in 2002 and to reach the 
internationally set target of .7 GDP by 2010.</P>
<P>A number of recent proposals have highlighted the need for increased 
cooperation around key areas. For example, UK chancellor Gordon Brown has 
proposed a US$50 billion a year investment fund for development targeted at 
building the capacity of developing countries to improve education and health 
systems.</P>
<P>The World Health Organisation Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, led by 
Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, has proposed that rich countries spend an extra 
one-tenth of 1 percent of their economies on the health of the poor. If all 
wealthy countries cooperated, it would add $38 billion a year to health spending 
by 2015. The commission argues that if that money went to poor nations that also 
spent more and improved their health care systems, these countries would see at 
least $360 billion a year in economic gains, lifting millions of people out of 
poverty and saving an estimated 8 million lives a year.</P>
<P>But as critical as increased and targeted aid clearly is, it won't be enough. 
Governments must also make more determined efforts to address the imbalances in 
global trade which currently favor rich over poor. Developing countries have 
heard many promises over the years but have too often found that, in practice, 
access to markets where they hold competitive advantages has been denied. I 
applaud the initiative of the European Union to open up markets to products from 
the Least Developed Countries under the "everything but arms" programme. This is 
a positive step forward.</P>
<P>An ethical globalization will also mean finding the right balance between 
public and private concerns and monitoring the impact of policy decisions. This 
is where the role of the private sector as an actor in improving how 
globalization works becomes increasingly clear. For example, the recent debate 
over access to HIV/AIDS drugs in developing countries has highlighted the 
potential conflicts between the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical 
companies which are vital for innovation and research and the rights of people 
facing life threatening disease to adequate health care. Making globalization 
respond to the needs of all people means finding ways to address such 
challenges.</P>
<P>A recent report by the World Bank includes an innovative proposal by Jean 
Lanjouw through which pharmaceutical companies would be able to choose to have 
their intellectual property rights in either developed or developing country 
markets, but not both. So, in the case of drugs that fight HIV/AIDS, companies 
who did the research and development primarily with rich country markets in mind 
would benefit by choosing patents for rich country markets. The drugs would be 
freely available in developing countries, but producers there could not export 
cheap drugs back to the rich countries. As the Bank report points out, the 
proposal would not discourage pharmaceutical companies from continuing research 
and development on global diseases for which the main market is in developing 
countries.</P>
<P>Another critical area where the private sector must play a bigger role if 
globalization is to benefit more people is employment generation. There are an 
estimated 66 million unemployed young people in the world today making up more 
than 40% of the world's total unemployed. What future can they expect without 
the opportunity of decent work? To highlight the urgency of the problem, the ILO 
estimates that the global economy will need to accommodate half a billion more 
people in developing countries over the next 10 years.</P>
<P>The UN has launched a Global Agenda for Employment as a way to focus the 
energies of UN agencies, the Bretton Woods Institutions, national governments, 
employers and trade unions on addressing these challenges.</P>
<H3>The Global Compact</H3>
<P>We must find ways of working in coalitions of common cause if 
globalization is to be sustainable and benefit all people. At the last session 
of the UN General Assembly, a special agenda item entitled "Towards Global 
Partnerships" was included for the first time. The Assembly recognised the need 
for increased efforts to enhance cooperation between the United Nations and all 
relevant partners, in particular the private sector.</P>
<P>The UN Global Compact initiative, which was formally launched by the 
Secretary-General in July of 2000, is becoming an overall framework through 
which the UN is pursuing its engagement with the private sector.</P>
<P>The Compact calls on business leaders, trade unions and NGOs to join forces 
behind a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labor standards and 
the environment. Let me outline briefly these three areas. With respect to human 
rights, corporations should ensure that they uphold and respect human rights as 
reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are not themselves 
complicit in human rights abuses. In the area of labour standards, businesses 
should uphold freedom of association and collective bargaining and make sure 
they are not employing under-age children or forced labor, either directly or 
indirectly, and that, in their hiring and firing policies they do not 
discriminate on grounds of race, creed, gender or ethnic origin. And in relation 
to the environment, companies should support a precautionary approach to 
environmental challenges, promote greater environmental responsibility and 
encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly 
technologies.</P>
<P>Many business leaders contend that if they were to act responsibly in 
countries with weak labor and environmental rules they would no longer be 
competitive. But times are changing. Consumers and shareholders alike are 
increasingly looking to common yard-sticks to measure corporate behavior.</P>
<P>That is why several hundred companies from countries such as Russia, China, 
Brazil, India, Germany, Norway, Indonesia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the 
United States and other UN member states from North and South have responded to 
the Global Compact and are working with labour unions, civil society and the UN 
to make its principles part of the strategic vision and everyday practices of 
companies in all regions. There are, I must note, no Irish companies to date 
involved and obviously I would like to see that changed.</P>
<P>Let me explain how we are involving the private sector in our human rights 
work at the UN. The Global Compact provided the framework for a private sector 
contribution to last year's World Conference against Racism through analysis and 
reflection on some very interesting initiatives by six companies from five 
continents on diversity, equality and non-discrimination in the workplace and 
surrounding communities. The Secretary-General participated in a high-level 
dialogue on these issues with Global Compact participating organizations on the 
opening day of the World Conference. A multi-stakeholder workshop looked at 
partnership approaches to fighting discrimination and fostering diversity and a 
panel we co-hosted with the ILO brought together trade union, company and UN 
representatives to share experiences of implementing equal-opportunity and 
diversity policies within organisations.</P>
<P>The resulting report of company experience titled "Discrimination is 
Everybody's Business" is available on the Global Compact website. I am also 
pleased to note that the initiative has inspired a number of national level 
initiatives between business and civil society that are getting underway this 
year.</P>
<P>We are also developing our role as a facilitator of dialogue with the private 
sector. For example, last December our Office hosted a workshop in Geneva 
between representatives of indigenous peoples and natural resource, energy and 
mining companies. The workshop discussed the relationship between those 
companies and indigenous peoples concerning the questions of land, consultation 
and revenue sharing and developed recommendations for further study and joint 
action.</P>
<P>The Global Compact is a voluntary initiative to promote good corporate 
citizenship. But I want to stress that it is not, and must not be, a mere public 
relations exercise. A commitment to the Global Compact must lead to concrete 
actions in support of the core principles.</P>
<P>A significant step towards ensuring the commitment of participants was taken 
earlier this month in the creation of a Global Compact Advisory Council which 
brings together senior business executives, international labor leaders, and 
heads of civil society organizations from across the world. The Council is the 
first UN advisory body composed of both public and private sector leaders, who 
together will assist the Secretary-General in his effort to promote cooperative 
solutions to the challenges of globalization.</P>
<H3>A role for business schools</H3>
<P>Finding cooperative solutions means learning from the experiences of 
others. It means understanding what works and what doesn't. This is clearly an 
area where much work remains to be done and where business schools are uniquely 
placed to assist.</P>
<P>One of the central goals of the Global Compact is the development of a 
Learning Forum which ultimately will serve as an information bank of disparate 
experiences - some successful and some not - of company efforts to implement the 
Compact's nine principles. By undertaking this work we hope to develop the 
elements of good practice both in addressing specific human rights, labour and 
environmental issues but also across industry sectors. This is the way we hope 
the Compact's principles may be embedded into the business practices of 
participating companies from around the world.</P>
<P>Are business schools ready to be a part of this effort to make globalization 
work for all? A recent survey of business schools by the Aspen Institute and the 
World Resource Institute suggests very little is being done to integrate social 
and environmental concerns into required MBA course work or to undertake 
rigorous research around these areas. The survey, titled "Beyond Grey Pinstripes 
2001" notes that while business leaders are under increasing pressures to solve 
complex social and environmental problems, business students are not being given 
the tools to prepare them for addressing these challenges.</P>
<P>Let me close by suggesting three ways that students and faculty here at the 
Smurfit School could join our efforts to make a new globalization possible:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Within the Global Compact, we at the UN are in real 
  need of academic partners to help us study how companies are implementing 
  their commitments to the Compact principles. By becoming part of our Learning 
  Forum, you would have a new window into the challenges companies face in being 
  both good corporate citizens and profitable. 
  </LI><LI>I would encourage all of you to consider how you 
  could bring your own networks together to multiply these efforts. Perhaps a 
  conference of students and faculty from European business schools to share 
  experiences and plan joint action around corporate citizenship issues could be 
  organized? My Office would be pleased to assist you in making such an event 
  possible. 
  </LI><LI>&nbsp;I would urge you also to consider what more could be done by the 
  private sector to help close the technology gap between the developed and the 
  developing world. You all know that this gap is widening by the day. The 
  terrific benefits of modern technology are not reaching many millions of poor 
  people on the planet. Research and development of new technologies are 
  overwhelmingly directed at rich country problems. </LI></OL>
<P>What a contribution it would be if the business and academic communities 
were to take the lead to share their expertise and skills with the poorest 
countries of the world. Think of the progress that could be made in addressing 
the crises of public health, agricultural productivity, environmental 
degradation and demographic stress which so many people have to face.</P>
<P>I truly believe that this is the only way we can move forward – through 
dialogue, a greater recognition of our shared responsibility and a commitment to 
working together to develop a new principled globalization.</P>
<P>Thank you.</P>
