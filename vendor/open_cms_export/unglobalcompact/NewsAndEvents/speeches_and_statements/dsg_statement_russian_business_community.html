          <H1>The Deputy Secretary-General Statement to Roundtable Meeting on Cooperation 
Between the United Nations and the Russian Business Community</H1>
<H2><BR>Moscow, Monday, 19 November 2001</H2>
<P>Foreign Minister Ivanov,<BR>Mr. Volzhky,<BR>Distinguished 
leaders of business and industry,<BR>United Nations colleagues,<BR>Ladies and 
Gentlemen, <BR>Thank you for this very warm welcome. I am always delighted to 
visit the Russian Federation, but this time I have come for a particularly 
exciting reason -- introducing the Russian business community to the Global 
Compact.</P>
<P>I am happy to be here with you today. I very much welcome the initiative of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in convening this 
meeting, and I appreciate the important role of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Employers in making this event possible. I am really glad to 
see so many prominent representatives of the Russian business community who have 
decided to be here today.</P>
<P>Before I get into the main topic of today's meeting - the Global Compact - 
let me first say a few words about the United Nations and where we stand today. 
It is clear that at this point in time, the aftermath of the 11 September 
terrorist attacks, including the situation in Afghanistan, is very much on our 
minds. The United Nations is poised to play a key role, both in the global fight 
against terrorism, and in assisting the Afghan people in building a more stable 
future in their country.</P>
<P>While this event has had a fundamental effect on the work of the United 
Nations, it has also provided evidence that the United Nations is a most 
valuable institution, with a machinery in place to face ever new challenges, 
while also continuing to pursue the old ones. Indeed, to remain relevant, the 
Organization must change and adjust to the political, economic, cultural and 
social transformations that determine relations between peoples and States. I 
believe we have been quite successful in keeping pace with these changes.</P>
<P>Today one can say, probably more than ever before, that there is a common 
vision of the purpose of the Organization shared by all its Members. Beyond the 
UN Charter itself, there has not always been such a shared vision, especially 
during the Cold War. But today, it exists: it is encapsulated in the Millennium 
Declaration adopted a little over a year ago at the Millennium Summit, the 
largest-ever gathering of world leaders. This Declaration has not become any 
less important after the 11 September events, on the contrary.</P>
<P>The Declaration establishes clear objectives and priorities for the United 
Nations: to overcome poverty, put an end to conflict, meet the needs of Africa, 
promote democracy and the rule of law, and protect our environment.</P>
<P>That is a pretty tall order. How can we hope to achieve these goals?</P>
<P>The United Nations of the 21st century cannot do its job alone. Since 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan took office almost five years ago, he has 
consistently advocated for strengthening partnerships with business and civil 
society. Only working together with actors outside the confines of the 
Organization itself can we hope to make a real difference in improving the lives 
of ordinary people. Therefore we are now consistently and vigorously interacting 
with non-governmental organizations, foundations, academic institutions and, of 
course, the business community.</P>
<P>The Secretary-General's strong-held view is that if the United Nations is to 
be equipped -- managerially, financially, politically -- to meet the needs of 
the world's people, it cannot afford to ignore the competencies, resources and 
networks offered by the private sector.</P>
<P>That is why, almost three years ago, the Secretary-General proposed a Global 
Compact to world business leaders, under which they commit themselves to respect 
a number of international norms in the areas of human rights, labour standards 
and the environment.Philosophically, the Compact rests on the premise that doing 
what is good for society is also good for business. Moreover, the Compact sees 
business as an agent of positive change -- as part of the solution.</P>
<P>The Global Compact calls on business leaders around the globe to embrace and 
implement nine principles, which have already been enshrined in international 
agreements. Let me briefly outline for you those principles:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In the area of human rights, businesses should 
  support the protection of human rights and make sure they are not complicit in 
  human rights abuses. 
  </LI><LI>&nbsp;In the area of labour standards, businesses 
  should uphold the freedom of association and the right to collective 
  bargaining; and they should work for the elimination of forced and compulsory 
  labour, child labour, and discrimination in the workplace. 
  </LI><LI>And with respect to the environment, businesses should support a 
  precautionary approach to environmental challenges, promote greater 
  environmental responsibility, and encourage the development and diffusion of 
  environmentally friendly technologies.</LI></UL>
<P>The idea is to weave these principles into corporate practices everywhere. 
The Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument or a legally binding code of 
conduct. Rather, the Compact is a voluntary initiative to promote good corporate 
citizenship.</P>
<P>I should stress that the Compact is not, and must not be, a public relations 
exercise. Pledging support is a necessary first step. But this is not enough. A 
commitment must lead to concrete actions in support of the principles. This is 
the core challenge. Companies must reflect the nine principles in their policies 
and in their practices. We have placed much emphasis on the Compact as a 
learning forum, where companies share their experiences and engage in dialogue 
with NGOs and trade unions. I would like to encourage Russian companies to set 
up their own Russian Global Compact Network, as a way to promote the exchange of 
experiences in translating the nine principles into their day-to-day operations. 
Such a Network can also be a platform for all stakeholders to together seek 
solutions to challenges.</P>
<P>In addition to establishing partnerships with labour and civil society 
organizations Companies are also encouraged to work with the United Nations and 
other development actors. In some countries, for example, companies 
participating in the Compact have joined with others in trying to reduce 
emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Russian companies could 
take steps to confront the many acute environmental challenges that Russia 
faces.</P>
<P>Another example of an area where the business community has worked in 
partnership with Governments and the United Nations is the issue of HIV/AIDS. 
The situation in the world concerning the rapid spread of the disease is a 
matter of great concern, and regretfully, this part of the world is not immune. 
The first warning signals might already be there. At the end of last year, an 
estimated 300,000 people in the Russian Federation were living with HIV -- twice 
as many as the year before. In Ukraine, the figure is more than 250,000 people. 
If allowed to spread, HIV/AIDS can have serious effects on the economy of a 
country. An increase in the numbers of people affected will certainly have 
adverse effects on business.</P>
<P>But the private sector can play an important role. In some countries, 
companies have contributed to drawing up effective AIDS policies and educating 
the work force about HIV. Businesses can also integrate HIV awareness and 
prevention messages in marketing and public relations. As respected members of 
their communities, business leaders are also uniquely placed to advocate, and to 
encourage all sectors of society to get involved, showing that they care for the 
people in their communities and not only for the "bottom line".</P>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>The Global Compact offers a historic opportunity to further strengthen ties 
between Russia and the United Nations, and to usher in a new era in Russian 
corporate culture. Encouraging businesses to act in support of broader societal 
goals can go a long way towards creating more effective markets, and building 
more inclusive, stable societies. This will be of benefit to the companies, to 
the employees, and to the communities themselves. The Global Compact initiative 
is also an excellent platform for building and strengthening the relationship 
among companies, Government bodies, labour, NGOs and international 
organizations.</P>
<P>And here I would like to come back to the shared vision I mentioned at the 
beginning of my speech, the hopes for a better world embodied in the Millennium 
Declaration. I believe that we all share a yearning to reach these noble goals. 
The Global Compact is a way for the business community to contribute, within 
their sphere of influence, to making progress towards attaining these goals and 
being a positive force in their communities.</P>
<P>I wish you a productive and enlightening session this afternoon.</P>
<P>Thank you.</P>
