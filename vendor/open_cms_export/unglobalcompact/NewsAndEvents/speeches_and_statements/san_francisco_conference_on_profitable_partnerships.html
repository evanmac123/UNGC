          <H1>Statement by Mary Robinson, United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights at Business for Social Responsibility Conference on Profitable 
Partnerships</H1>
<H2>Building Relationships That Make a Difference<BR>&nbsp;<BR>San 
Francisco, 3 November 1999</H2>
<P>It is a pleasure to return to San Francisco to address 
the annual conference of Business for Social Responsibility. At an early stage 
in my term as High Commissioner I began to appreciate the role business can play 
in relation to human rights and that business was increasingly interested in the 
subject. In the summer of 1998 I accepted an invitation to visit BSR's office 
here just to check them out! They passed - with honours - I was impressed by 
small details: the concern for an environmentally friendly office, the 
multicultural and gender balanced staff, their evident enthusiasm and 
commitment, and the sense of a team which had thought through its responses to 
complex ethical and moral issues.</P>
<P>I welcome the opportunity to take stock with you of where the debate now is 
on business and human rights. In the past 50 years, the world has made progress 
in economic growth and wealth creation on a scale previously unimagined. This 
progress has been accompanied by significant improvements in human development 
indicators such as life expectancy, levels of education and nutrition standards. 
The business sector has been and continues to be the backbone of this sustained 
progress.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no better example of how business moves this process forward 
than the revolution taking place here in California. The new technologies being 
created and developed here have accounted for the lion's share of U.S. economic 
expansion in recent years and will undoubtedly play an increasing role in the 
years ahead.</P>
<P>But as we marvel at the power of business to generate ideas and products 
which in turn contribute to higher standards of living for many, we should not 
lose sight of other signs and indicators which make our view of the world more 
complex on the eve of a new millennium. Concerns are expressed by many people 
who believe the system which has produced so much prosperity for some, threatens 
many others.</P>
<P>As Mike Moore, the new Director-General of the WTO put it recently: 
Increasing numbers, not just in the United States, feel excluded, forgotten and 
angry, locked out and waiting for a promised train that may never arrive. They 
see globalization as a threat, the enemy. A central policy challenge for 
governments is to make the prosperity that flows from globalization accessible 
to people." Let us hope the upcoming Seattle Ministerial Conference of the WTO 
will be able to contribute to the aims Mr. Moore has set for himself: an outcome 
which benefits the most vulnerable economies, a more open trading system that 
can contribute to better living standards and a safer world and a WTO which can 
reflect the needs of all its members.</P>
<P>For there is still much debate as to whether making a bigger economic cake" 
will lead to better living standards. There is little disagreement, however, 
about how much remains to be done to fight against poverty and the inequality of 
opportunities and development which continue to plague the majority of the 
world's people. Well known statistics highlight these problems -- three billion 
people live on less than $2 a day. The growth in real per-capita income in the 
countries of sub-Saharan Africa from 1960 to 1995 was only $28. The overall gap 
between the richest 20% of humanity and the poorest 20% doubled between 1940 and 
1990. And if the gap between rich and poor countries is growing, so too is the 
phenomenon of poverty and exclusion within societies. In many developing 
countries, even those experiencing some increase in net national wealth, the gap 
between the poorest in society and the richest has been growing 
dramatically.</P>
<H3>The social responsibility movement</H3>
<P>It is a pleasure for me to have the opportunity of raising these issues with 
a group of people who are looking ahead and asking the tough questions about the 
future - the leaders of some of the most successful and well known corporations 
in the world who are also the leaders of the corporate social responsibility 
movement. BSR companies are on the vanguard of a process which has taken on 
incredible energy and direction over the past few years. I hope I will be able 
to hear also from you about the progress you've made and the challenges you face 
as you work not only to produce good products and services, but also healthier 
societies.</P>
<P>During this conference, you will be seeking to advance further some of the 
real breakthroughs which are being made by business leaders in this movement. 
This progress is due in large part to the work of organizations like BSR which 
are leading a fundamental reshaping of the way business is done. BSR's broad 
membership of influential companies, your extensive research and publications as 
well as a wide range of training and technical assistance activities are 
invaluable resources for companies which have recognized that the triple bottom 
line of economic, environmental and social performance is now being watched by 
shareholders and by wider society alike.</P>
<P>I would not want to let this opportunity pass without expressing my 
admiration for the work of BSR's Chairman, Arnold Hiatt, who is one of the true 
pioneers of this movement. Arnold's commitment to this cause began, as human 
rights begin, to borrow Eleanor Roosevelt's words, in small places...close to 
home". Over 20 years ago Arnold did what every good business leader must - he 
thought not only about the needs of his customers, but also about the needs of 
his employees and the wider community and their links to his company's success. 
He then convinced his board of directors that addressing in practical ways the 
needs of the community would not only be the right thing to do, but would also 
be the profitable thing to do.</P>
<H3>The Challenges to Human Rights</H3>
<P>I am aware of other business leaders going the extra step needed, reaching 
beyond codes of conduct and external audits in efforts to construct industry 
wide inspection systems such as the Fair Labor Association, a monitoring group 
composed of industry and human-rights representatives that was created a year 
ago by a Presidential task force.</P>
<P>But why does ensuring greater respect for human rights matter to you? My 
hunch is that I don't need to make the argument to this group. You already 
understand that consumers are increasingly well informed about how products are 
manufactured or produced, and whether a company treats its workers well. You 
don't underestimate the extent to which investors are putting their money into 
socially responsible business funds. You recognize that without respect for 
human rights and the rule of law in our increasingly global village, you will 
eventually, if not already, find yourself trying to do business in unstable 
political and social environments where not only your employees' health and 
safety are at risk but also your opportunities for building new markets and 
continued growth.</P>
<P>So if we agree that human rights are important to business, we should ask 
ourselves - are they being respected universally? The answer is clear and 
challenging -- Awe have a lot of work to do". One need only consider the massive 
violations of human rights this year alone in places like Kosovo, Sierra Leone 
or East Timor to understand the enormity of the challenge still ahead. As 
terrible as these situations are, there are perhaps even more troubling 
violations of fundamental rights which aren't part of the daily news because 
they have tragically become almost commonplace -- the 12 million children who 
die each year under the age of five from preventable diseases, the 1.3 billion 
people who do not have access to clean water, the millions of women and girls 
throughout the world for whom primary education remains only a dream.</P>
<P>Having served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for just over two 
years now and seeing first-hand the state of human rights in all parts of the 
world, I am more convinced than ever that lasting progress requires first and 
foremost that governments live up to the letter of their commitments to human 
rights. Yet I recognize more now than I did two years ago, that in many 
countries, due to severe lack of resources and in some places to the lasting 
effects of history, even the best intentions of governments will not be enough. 
Real progress will require innovative, mutually beneficial partnerships at all 
levels between governments, corporations, non-governmental organizations, 
international organizations and all others committed to a world where 
fundamental rights are guaranteed for all people.</P>
<P>What will happen if we don't do more? My fear is that in our interdependent 
world, unless concrete actions are taken now to effectively implement human 
rights, the progress enjoyed by many countries over the last fifty years and the 
spread of democratic societies in all regions will not be sustainable.</P>
<P>That is why I draw such encouragement from the commitments that all of you 
have made to making the world a better place. And why I count on you to go 
further - to expand your network ever wider - and to look for new and innovative 
ways of achieving these common goals.</P>
<H3>Turning Commitments into Actions</H3>
<P>One of the most visible results of the increased attention paid to the links 
between business and human rights is the development of corporate policies and 
practices which address human rights issues directly. This is evidenced by 
internal ethical statements, corporate codes of conduct, sectoral agreements on 
issues such as child labour in the clothing industry, or wider codes such as 
Social Accountability 8000 and the new Sullivan principles which are to be 
commended.</P>
<P>The focus has rightly been placed on identifying and correcting business 
practices which result in clear violations of human rights standards such as 
child and forced labor, unsafe working conditions, illegal transportation and 
dumping of toxic waste to name some of the most evident practices which, 
unfortunately, have been only too common in the past.</P>
<P>I believe we are now moving into a crucial stage in this evolving process - 
namely, developing the systems through which the commitments made by companies 
to protect human rights, labour and environmental standards can be monitored 
effectively to ensure compliance. Taking initiatives such as the Fair Labor 
Association (FLA) as the next step. In other words, ensuring that actions match 
commitments. This, by the way, is the main challenge which governments also 
face. Human rights standards are, by and large, now in place - implementation 
must follow.</P>
<P>This is no easy task. Later this afternoon the focus of one of your breakout 
sessions will be the topic of Innovative Approaches to Monitoring". I was 
interested to read about the study of factory conditions recently conducted by 
the research organization IHS in Indonesia on behalf of Reebok which will be 
discussed during this session. What is particularly impressive in this case is 
Reebok's willingness to be open about the problems which the study pointed out. 
It is an important example for other companies who are struggling with similar 
issues.</P>
<P>But even as significant efforts are being made to ensure that initiatives 
such as codes are rigorously complied with, some argue that even more must be 
done. It has been noted that the absence of uniform definitions among various 
codes and the variety of methods of implementation may result in ad-hoc 
approaches which run the risk of being short-lived. Others have asked whether 
the business community will be able to mobilize across-the-board support for 
balancing global governance structures in favour of human rights, labour, the 
environment and development.</P>
<H3>Business and the United Nations</H3>
<P>These were some of the issues UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan hoped the 
United Nations could help to address when he proposed a "Global Compact" between 
the United Nations and the world business community earlier this year.</P>
<P>As many of you know, the Global Compact calls on business leaders to join 
forces behind a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour 
standards and the environment. In the area of human rights, corporations should 
ensure that they uphold and respect human rights and are not themselves 
complicit in human rights abuses. With respect to labour standards, businesses 
should make sure that they are not employing under-age children or forced labor, 
either directly or indirectly, and that, in their hiring and firing policies 
they do not discriminate on grounds of race, creed, gender or ethnic origin. And 
in relation to the environment, companies should support greater environmental 
responsibility and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally 
friendly technologies.</P>
<P>What makes these principles particularly important is that they already enjoy 
world-wide support, as embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Labor Organization's Declaration on fundamental principles and 
rights at work, and the Rio Declaration adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.</P>
<P>The immediate goal in implementing the Compact is to challenge the 
international business community to incorporate these universal values into 
mission statements; to change management practices to achieve these goals; and 
to share learning experiences. The three United Nations entities most directly 
involved in implementing the Global Compact, the International Labour 
Organization, the UN Environment Programme and the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights have joined forces to work together to promote the 
principles. A Compact-oriented website, dialogues among prospective partners, 
training exercises, and access to United Nations databases are among the 
mechanisms we are developing to make the Compact work.</P>
<P>My Office stands ready to support your initiatives. The approach we have 
adopted is a modest but we hope, a catalytic one. We seek to encourage, 
stimulate and support corporate initiatives in this area and to work with 
organizations like BSR to identify and recognize good practices. An idea your 
Chairman has been developing, which I fully support, is to establish an award 
for a business practice which has made a real impact on ensuring respect for the 
human rights of employees or communities. I hope we will be in a position to 
work together to make such an award a mark of real achievement, similar to the 
Baldridge Award for quality here in the United States. I am excited by the 
proposal to weave into the award a prize which will support the work of human 
rights organizations in all regions.</P>
<P>But let me be clear -- the Global Compact will only be a truly useful tool if 
it is able to produce something more than itself. This will require a process in 
which the interests of the UN system, the business community and our 
non-governmental organization partners converge around common goals. These goals 
must then be transformed into partnerships that contribute to achieving the UN's 
mandate of enhancing international cooperation to promote, as the UN Charter 
puts it - Asocial progress and better standards of living in larger 
freedom".</P>
<P>I recognize the amount of work which will be required to use the common 
framework of the Global Compact as a guide for entering into innovative 
partnerships which produce real results both for business and for people. I also 
believe that the business community will have to continue to drive this process 
forward. The UN's added value comes through the international standards 
themselves, an understanding of local and country situations and its ability to 
bring all relevant actors together to address<BR>common problems.</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>If I could leave you with one thought: don't underestimate the role you can 
play in shaping the future of human rights as we approach the new millennium. 
Consider the information technology revolution and just imagine what your 
creativity and knowledge could contribute to improved access to education for 
all. Or how your ability to innovate could help ensure adequate distribution of 
food, energy, building materials and healthcare - all of which, by the way, 
would contribute to the realization of fundamental rights enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration and the International Covenants.</P>
<P>Your ability to make a difference was brought home to me recently. I read 
about Noah Samara, the Ethiopian-born founder of a company which is producing a 
digital radio made for developing markets that connects with various power 
sources, including solar panels. In addition to selling time to various 
broadcasters who will reach new audiences through the system, Mr. Samara will 
use 5% of his profits to provide free digital radios to the poorest villages in 
Africa and to provide basic information including educational and health 
programming. Mr. Samara says it best: People need so many things in these areas 
-- information on hygiene, how to be better entrepreneurs...If we can do that, 
we will help them break through some of the hardest barriers."</P>
<P>This one initiative has the potential to make a real difference, to empower 
people not just in one community but in thousands. There is a lesson there -- to 
look beyond your horizons, to put to the ultimate use the creativity and energy 
which you hold. To build a future where human rights are a reality for all 
people.</P>
<P>I wish you every success for this year's conference.</P>
<P>Thanks</P>
