          <H1>Remarks on the Global Compact</H1>
<H2>By Georg Kell, United Nations</H2>
<H2>Corporate Citizenship: Defining the New Responsibilities </H2>
     
<H2>24 October 2000 at Chatham House, London </H2>
<P>The Global Compact, an initiative introduced by the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations in January 1999, has captured the 
imagination of many people. Today, almost two years later, it seems appropriate 
to review developments and to assess future prospects for this novel form of 
partnership involving the UN, corporations, NGOs and labour. <BR>More 
specifically, I want to reflect on the following three questions:</P>
<P>First , is the main idea behind the Compact still valid today or have 
political, economic or social developments over the past two years changed the 
context within which the Compact was constructed?</P>
<P>Second, have we made enough progress to know that the Global Compact is a 
viable operational concept?</P>
<P>Third, what are the key challenges ahead?</P>
<P>Let me deal with each question in turn.</P>
<H3>A. Taking stock of developments</H3>
<P>When the Compact was launched, Kofi Annan warned that imbalances between 
rapidly expanding global markets and societal preferences must be reduced if a 
backlash was to be averted. To avoid repeating mistakes of the past, we had to 
learn to apply at the global level what we all take for granted at the national 
level: markets that are embedded in values shared by everybody. This required 
filling a void and reconnecting markets with communities. One way forward was to 
promote a sense of global citizenship in which rights were coupled with 
responsibilities. The international business community, the main driver and 
beneficiary of globalization, was asked to help by enacting nine universal 
principles within their sphere of influence.</P>
<P>Events in Seattle ten months later confirmed the timeliness and relevance of 
the Secretary-General's message. But how have broad economic, political and 
social changes over the past two years affected the context of the Compact? Have 
they widened or diminished the imbalances that are at the root of the backlash? 
Three issues are relevant in this context: how access to opportunities are 
distributed; how regulatory imbalances between the economic and the social 
sphere are addressed; and how popular reactions to the opening up of markets and 
the free flow of information are playing out.</P>
<P>The first question, then, is whether recent trends in private sector or 
government activity have brought about a more inclusive globalization process, 
more access to opportunities for the disadvantaged and, ultimately, a more equal 
distribution of benefits.</P>
<P>Yes, globalization is marching on. Foreign direct investment is setting new 
records and contributing positively to development in many countries. It is 
expected to exceed one trillion dollars by the end of this year. Large companies 
are becoming more transnational and powerful, and the global system of 
international production is both broadening and deepening. Today, the total 
stock of FDI in GDP is 14%, up from 2% two decades ago, according to UNCTAD's 
latest World Investment Report.</P>
<P>But investment flows remain highly concentrated. Ten developing countries 
alone account for over 70% of all investment inflows that go to the developing 
world. Many least developed and small economies are left behind, and the real 
losers are those that are willing to attract capital flows but receive little, 
if any. Economic exclusion and persistent high levels of poverty remain an 
unresolved problem in many parts of the world. The rapid accumulation of wealth 
in other parts of the world accentuates further the difference between the 
"haves" and the "have-nots", or between the ones who are "in" and those who are 
left out.</P>
<P>Yes, markets respond to demand and not to needs, and we should not expect 
that they bring about a convergence of income across the board. But can we then 
say that governments have become serious in reducing economic imbalances? Have 
they demonstrated global leadership and created a more inclusive global market? 
Unfortunately, the record of the past two years is not encouraging. Little 
progress has been made on the vital issue of market access and debt relief and 
commitments to ODA remain at historically low levels. It is indeed one of the 
great tragedies of our era that politics remain local, while markets and 
problems have gone global.</P>
<P>The next question then is whether imbalances in global rule making have been 
addressed. Today, as two years ago, there is a gap between the economic and the 
social sphere. Rules favoring the expansion of global markets have become fairly 
robust, while those intended to promote social objectives, whether poverty 
reduction, human rights and the environment, continue to lag behind. This 
imbalance continues to tempt many activists to hijack economic rules and their 
actors, at the risk of putting into jeopardy what has been achieved so far. It 
also reveals a fundamental dilemma of globalization: how to justify a system 
that stands ready to enforce intellectual property rights, but turns a blind eye 
when it comes to the most basic human rights.</P>
<P>Finally, as trade and investment increasingly impact domestic affairs and 
virtually every aspect of economic life, the opening up of markets continues to 
provoke fear and unease. Learning to live with uncertainty and major 
disturbances can put to the test any governance structure at any time. But 
unfounded fears are a breeding ground for irrational reactions. Globalization 
continues to serve as a convenient platform for all sorts of irrational 
reactions and as a scapegoat to advance narrow interests, both for social 
movements of all colours and for policy makers on both extreme ends of the old 
political spectrum.</P>
<P>This cursory review of broad economic, regulatory and social trends would 
strongly suggest that the idea behind the Compact is at least as relevant today 
as it was two years ago. The choice before us remains the same. Either we 
reconnect markets with society by building the pillars that markets need to be 
sustainable, or we risk a rollback -- if not a crushing end to 
globalization.</P>
<H3>B. Reviewing progress</H3>
<P>Let me now turn to the second question that I posed at the outset: can the 
idea of the Global Compact be translated into viable action to advance the 
overriding objective of creating a more stable and inclusive global market? I do 
not pretend to have a definite answer. But I can say that we have made good 
progress on several fronts.</P>
<P>A pivotal meeting between Compact participants and the Secretary-General was 
held on 26 July. This event confirmed the validity of another key assumption of 
the Global Compact: that the international business community should become 
active and act out of enlightened self-interest because:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>it would play into the core strengths of business 
  rather than exploit the host society's weakness;</LI><LI>&nbsp;it would help companies to remember their home 
  constituencies and thereby safeguard reputation;</LI><LI>the principles are a useful value basis for internal 
  business codes that international business needs to hold people and operations 
  together;</LI><LI>it is the 'right thing to do'; large companies cannot 
  be successful simply by cutting corners;</LI><LI>no other voluntary initiative can claim comparable 
  universality and legitimacy;</LI><LI>the Compact is the UN Secretary-General's initiative and virtually all 
  heads of state and government have endorsed the nine principles.</LI></UL>
<P>These arguments were in principle understood. But motivating business to take 
a public stand required collective action; many individual companies, given a 
choice, prefer sitting on the fence. The 26 July event at UN Headquarters showed 
that such collective action was possible. Close to 50 transnational companies, 
including leading companies from developing countries (Mexico, Peru, Brazil, 
South Africa, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong) came forward, 
many of them for the first time.</P>
<P>We have also made good progress in defining goals, concepts and 
operational tools. This includes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>A definition of complementary strategic goals:</LI><LI>Make the nine principles of the Global Compact an 
  integral part of corporate activities everywhere.</LI><LI>Offer a platform for dialogue and action in support 
  of the principles and in support of broad UN goals.</LI><LI>A clear understanding what is expected from business 
  supporting the Compact:</LI><LI>Issue a clear statement in support of the Compact and 
  its principles.&nbsp;</LI><LI>Post once a year on the Global Compact website a 
  concrete example of progress made or lesson learned in implementing the 
  principles.&nbsp;</LI><LI>Engage in partnership with UN organizations by 
  undertaking activities that further the application of the principles, or by 
  entering strategic partnerships in support of broad UN goals.</LI><LI>A clear understanding that the Compact follows an 
  action and learning model, not one that is based on monitoring and compliance 
  measurement. Business is expected to share experiences about what works and 
  what doesn't, and demonstrate their good intentions by concrete action as 
  opposed to explaining how well they are doing in meeting the principles.</LI><LI>A clear understanding that labour and civil society 
  play a crucial role in anchoring the Compact in the fabric of communities – 
  local and global.</LI><LI>Recognition that the Compact must serve as a broad 
  framework for complementary regional, national, sectoral or local initiatives. 
  Convergence towards the universal principles of the Compact, where 
  appropriate, is desirable.</LI><LI>Recognition that the Global Compact, like any other 
  voluntary initiative, cannot be a substitute for government action. Neither 
  should one expect business to do what is the job of governments.</LI><LI>A website was built around the principles, issues and the actors. <BR>We have aspirations to further develop 
  this website into a portal on universal values and business and use it as a 
  forum for structured dialogue.</LI><LI>A global network of engaging actors has been 
  assembled, including: global business associations (ICC, IOE), a number of 
  global, sectoral associations and others (WBCSD, PWBLF, BSR and others), 
  international labour (ICFTU) and issue-oriented civil society organizations 
  with global reach in the area of human rights, environment and development 
  (AI, ILC, HRW, WWF, IUCN, RingNetwork, Transparency International, Save the 
  Children and others).</LI><LI>A Global Compact Office is currently being established. Reporting directly 
  to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General, its mission is to leverage 
  authority, catalyze action and ensure optimum synergies. It will work closely 
  with the UN agencies most directly involved (ILO, UNEP, OHCHR) and other parts 
  of the system, including UNDP.</LI></UL>
<P>Overall, we now have a good platform for catalyzing action. Already, the 
three UN agencies most directly involved are working with Global Compact 
participants to overcome dilemmas in the application of the principles; a number 
of strategic partnership projects in support of UN goals are taking shape; and 
select high-profile global dialogues on critical issues are under preparation. 
Outreach efforts to engage more companies in all regions of the world are well 
under way at the regional, national and local levels. But clearly, it is far too 
early to make assessments regarding the impact of these activities.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>C. Looking ahead</H3>
<P></P>
<P>Like any other bold initiative, the Compact has provoked much controversy, 
some of it public, some not. Dealing with criticism and balancing conflicting 
interests will be essential to avoid the process being derailed or abused.</P>
<P>To counter skepticism on the business side, greater efforts must be made to 
explain that complying with laws is not always enough, and that sitting on the 
fence or opting for convenient temporary parking stations may not pay off in the 
long term. To be convincing, we need to be able to show the business case for 
global corporate citizenship.</P>
<P>And, we need to show that the "learning" and "action" model is a viable one. 
This means that the Compact must help to define what are good and best 
practices, stimulate laggards to move into a higher performance and motivating 
good performers to come forward and share their experience. Regarding "actions" 
there is much scope to make tangible progress both at the policy level and at 
the ground.</P>
<P>As for criticism from civil society organizations that are not 
participating in the Global Compact, we must learn to distinguish more clearly 
among the actors and their motives. Many of them are genuinely concerned about 
the risks involved to the image of the United Nations. In turn, we genuinely 
appreciate their concern. We, too, are aware of those potential risks; we are 
doing our best to manage them and we hope to be able to count on civil society's 
continued vigilance and assistance.</P>
<P>Other concerns are more difficult to reconcile. Chief among these are the 
divergent views about openness as a political and an economic concept. Here, we 
do not have a choice. Too much is at stake. Our overriding priority must be the 
interests of developing countries and all others who depend on trade, investment 
and technology transfers to improve prospects for the poor. Unilateralism, 
protectionism and exporting domestic policy dilemmas -- at the expense of weaker 
players -- is not an option. Multilateral cooperation, non-discrimination, 
reciprocity and transparency are our best defense. We cannot compromise on this 
understanding.</P>
<P>Finally, there are a few activists who thrive on hostility and point scoring. 
We have to learn that they are not interested in dialogue or bridge 
building.</P>
<P>However, it is also true that social change is not linear. It requires at 
least the existence of two complementary and at times contradictory forces: 
creating awareness and mobilizing willingness to change is one of them. Making 
constructive use of resulting energies is the other. The Compact is clearly a 
constructive instrument. But it is tied up in the interplay of the two forces; 
to succeed, we need to learn to maintain a healthy balance between them. One 
priority at this juncture is to avoid destructive motives gaining the upper 
hand.</P>
<P>Another critical balancing act is to avoid a blurring of the lines between 
public and private responsibilities. Already, governments are divesting 
responsibilities, and there is a temptation to use the notion of corporate 
citizenship or social responsibility to to justify this. But governments 
continue to hold the key for unlocking economic opportunities; leaders failing 
their own people continue to constitute the single biggest source of human 
misery. True, the Compact is premised on the real world, where governance is 
imperfect, and where business exerts considerable influence. But this should not 
mean that we endorse or support that imperfect world, or lose sight of the ideal 
world, where governments live up fully to their responsibilities. In such a 
perfect world, indeed, the role of business would simply be business, and the 
notion of corporate citizenship or responsibility would be reduced to complying 
with laws.</P>
<P>Finally, there is the challenge of devising the right structures to catalyze 
the right actions, including questions as to who is a partner or participant in 
this undertaking. As far as possible, we have resisted the temptation to try to 
formalize structures. Doing so would undermine the innovative approach of the 
Compact; it would institutionalize the problems without solving the 
dilemmas.</P>
<P>The Compact is an institutional experiment, or what we like to call an OAM 
(Open Action Model). There is no vested institutional interest. There is no 
membership or signing on. All that matters is a commitment to action and 
performance that contributes to the achievement of the goals.</P>
<P>But clearly, we can only succeed if all those who share our goals come 
forward, help us define the content and carry through the action we need to 
succeed. Only then will we succeed. I hope we can count on your 
support.<BR>Thank you for your attention. </P>
