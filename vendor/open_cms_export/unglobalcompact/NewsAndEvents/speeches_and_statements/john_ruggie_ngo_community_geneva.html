          <H1>Remarks on the Global Compact to the NGO Community</H1>
<H2>Assistant Secretary-General John Ruggie<BR>&nbsp;<BR>United 
Nations, Geneva, 13 October 2000 </H2>
<P>Thank you for the opportunity of meeting with you this morning. 
I very much appreciate your interest and look forward to a good discussion. 
<BR>I'm here today to talk about the Secretary-General's Global Compact, but 
also more broadly about globalization. Specifically, I want to do three things: 
First, to describe the GC, briefly and factually, as a concrete initiative what 
it seeks to accomplish and how. Second, to place the GC in perspective. What is 
it about, in the broader and deeper context of globalization? And third, I want 
to address very frankly criticisms the GC has generated in some parts of the NGO 
community.</P>
<H3>1. The Global Compact</H3>
<P>The GC is an initiative intended to promote corporate social responsibility 
and citizenship in the new global marketplace. It seeks to utilize the power of 
transparency and dialogue as its chief tools. And it is a collaborative effort 
involving not only the United Nations and corporations, but also international 
labor and NGOs as core participants.</P>
<P>The GC is not designed as a regulatory instrument. Nor should it be seen as a 
substitute for any regulatory arrangement that either countries or companies 
might wish to construct. It represents an altogether different type of 
organizational activity: an open-ended experiment intended to identify, 
disseminate and promote good practices based on universal principles.</P>
<P>As many of you know, the GC encompasses nine such principles, drawn from the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO's Fundamental Principles on 
Rights at Work and the Rio Principles on Environment and Development. The ILO, 
OHCHR and UNEP are the core UN partners, along with UNDP to manage the 
operational dimensions.</P>
<P>The GC asks companies to act on the nine principles in their own corporate 
domains, moving towards "good practices" as understood by the broader 
international community, rather than relying on their often superior bargaining 
position vis-à-vis national authorities to get away with less.</P>
<P>Specifically, we ask companies to undertake three commitments:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>To advocate the GC and its 9 principles in mission statements, annual 
  reports and similar public venues;</LI>
  <LI>To post on our website at least once a year the concrete steps they are 
  taking to act on the 9 principles – discussing lessons learned, both positive 
  and negative;</LI>
  <LI>To join with us in partnership projects of benefit to developing countries 
  – either policy dialogues (e.g., the role of corporations in zones of 
  conflict) or operational activities (e.g., the Health InterNetwork, or 
  Ericsson's First on the Ground initiative). </LI></OL>
<P>Our labor and NGO partners play essential roles in these endeavors. Their 
contribution will be particularly important in the on-line dialogue concerning 
good practices that lies at the heart of the learning experience the GC hopes to 
promote.</P>
<P>Following a high-level kickoff event at the UN on 26 July, our efforts have 
been focused on achieving practical results – and letting those results speak 
for themselves. And we have been devising a recruitment strategy to hit our 
target of 1,000 major companies within 3 years.</P>
<P>So, that's the Compact itself. What is it about, in the broader context of 
globalization?</P>
<H3>2. The GC and Globalization</H3>
<P></P>
<P>The GC is a voluntary instrument promoting corporate social responsibility. 
It isn't the only way to achieve that aim, but it is one way.</P>
<P>Do we believe that companies all of a sudden have become altruists? Certainly 
not and I, for one, would be deeply suspicious if any made that claim. They're 
in business to make money. The issue is how they choose to make their money.</P>
<P>Although the motivations of company participants in the GC vary, I can 
imagine several reasons for their wanting to join up.</P>
<P>The most encompassing is the protection and promotion of the company brand 
which accounts for an ever increasing, and in some cases overwhelming, share of 
companies' market valuation. In that context, it pays for them to be seen to do 
good things.</P>
<P>Some companies have done bad things in the past, they've paid a price in 
public embarrassment and perhaps even diminished sales, and they want a new 
image.</P>
<P>Others have come to view global corporate social responsibility as a natural 
extension of corporate social responsibility in their home countries, as one of 
the rules of the game in the new global marketplace.</P>
<P>Still others particularly companies in cutting edge industries, where 
attracting absolutely the best personnel worldwide is the key to success have 
found that they can't sufficiently motivate the very best people only with 
monetary rewards. In such cases, more elevated social purposes are becoming part 
of corporate culture.</P>
<P>Finally, there may be companies looking to the GC for a free ride mere 
publicity, or co-branding with the UN, as it were with little intention of doing 
what we ask of them. If so, they ought to be aware that they are operating in a 
fish bowl. We are alert. Our NGO and labor partners are watching. And I know 
that you will share with us your information and suggestions which many of you 
have done already.</P>
<P>In short, as markets are going global, so, too, must corporate social 
responsibility and citizenship. The GC is one means towards that end.</P>
<P>But aren't there risks, as some of you have warned? Of course there are. When 
has anything worthwhile not involved risks?</P>
<P>But is this worthwhile?</P>
<P>On that question, where you stand fundamentally depends on where you sit. If 
you want to make globalization work for everyone, as we do, then it is 
worthwhile. But if you reject globalization, global corporations or even the 
system of capitalism itself, then you won't like what we're doing at all, any 
more than your predecessors liked social Keynesianism or social democracy 
because such pragmatic innovations inevitably reduce the social rationale and 
political support for more polarized rejectionist postures.</P>
<P>The analogy is not entirely a bad one. By means of those heterodox measures, 
the industrialized countries in the first half of the 20th century slowly 
learned to embed market relations in shared values, principles and institutional 
practices at the national level.</P>
<P>The GC seeks to weave universal values and principles into global corporate 
behavior. And it brings together all the relevant social actors: governments, 
who defined the principles on which the GC is based; companies, whose behavior 
we are seeking to shape; labor, in whose hands the process of global production 
takes place; NGOs, representing the wider community of stakeholders; and the 
United Nations, the world's only truly global political entity.</P>
<P>So that's what the Global Compact is about.</P>
<H3>3. Some Areas of Disagreements</H3>
<P>The GC has attracted an enormous amount of attention in the world's press, 
most of it supportive, and in the NGO community, some of it quite negative. My 
favorite assessment in the press, it won't surprise you, was an editorial in the 
Christian Science Monito no free-market apologist describing the GC as Kofi 
Annan's "most creative reinvention yet of the United Nations.</P>
<P>Certain criticisms by activist groups I won't dignify with a response; 
they're the one's that question Kofi Annan's motivations. The 
Secretary-<BR>General is doing what he's doing because he believes it to be the 
right thing. If the GC turns out not to work as intended we will adapt it, and 
if it's a flop it will be dropped.</P>
<P>A larger number of NGOs and activist groups are genuinely concerned about the 
risks involved to the image and reputation of the United Nations. In turn, we 
genuinely appreciate their concern. We, too, are aware of those potential risks, 
as I've indicated, and will do our best to manage them. I hope we can count on 
your assistance.</P>
<P>A third area of disagreement is the most profound and, therefore, the most 
difficult to resolve. It concerns differing attitudes toward globalization.</P>
<P>When Secretary-General Annan first proposed the Global Compact in January 
1999, he stated categorically that globalization, as we knew it, was not 
sustainable. Indeed, he predicted precisely the kind of backlash that hit ten 
months later at Seattle and in various venues since.</P>
<P>A backlash against globalization, the Secretary-General explained, would be 
fueled by three of its attributes. First, its benefits are distributed highly 
unequally, both within and among countries. Large parts of the developing world 
are left behind entirely; these are the countries where 1.2 billion people 
strive to survive on $1 a day, or nearly 3 billion on $2 a day.</P>
<P>Second, globalization is characterized by an imbalance in global rule making. 
Those rules that favor global market expansion have become more robust and 
enforceable in the last decade or two. Rules intended to promote equally valid 
social objectives, whether poverty reduction, labor standards, human rights, 
environmental quality or the control of transnational criminal activity, lag 
behind and in some instances actually have become weaker.</P>
<P>And third, there is emerging what we might call a global identity crisis. Who 
is us? is being asked with growing shrillness all over the world. Who is in 
control of the unpredictable forces that can bring on economic instability and 
social dislocation, sometimes at lightning speed? The answer, no one, serves 
only to feed fear and even paranoia apart from the fact that it is not, strictly 
speaking, accurate.</P>
<P>The Secretary-General committed himself, and the United Nations, to help 
reverse these adverse attributes and consequences of globalization.</P>
<P>But we do not reject the very phenomenon of globalization. And therein lies 
the major difference between us, and some of our friends in your community.</P>
<P>The world needs open markets. They are required to sustain prosperity in the 
industrialized world. And they provide the only hope of pulling billions of poor 
people in the developing countries out of abject poverty.</P>
<P>This view has nothing to do with the so-called Washington consensus and it is 
not an endorsement of laissez-faire economics. It implies acceptance neither of 
unfettered growth nor the commodification of everything under the sun. It is 
just a plain, irrefutable fact of life in our world of 6 billion people, half of 
them poor – soon to become 8 billion, with 9 out of every 10 newcomers born into 
extreme poverty.</P>
<P>Poverty has been exploding in Africa but it is hardly because of too much 
globalization. According to the latest UNCTAD figures, the share of direct 
foreign investment allocated to Africa has now shrunk to 1.2% of the global 
total 1.2% for a continent that accounts for more than ten times that fraction 
of the world's population. In contrast, poverty is declining in East Asia, and 
more modestly in South Asia, where much of the direct foreign investment 
destined for the developing countries has been heading.</P>
<P>You have been honest with us about your concerns regarding the Global 
Compact. Let me be equally frank and end with a grave concern of my own. I fear 
that the rejectionists of globalization in the North are on a collision course 
with the needs of the poor in the South however unintended it may be. Nurtured 
and sustained by the greatest accumulation of wealth the world has ever known, 
northern rejectionists are driven by a cultural alienation from the institutions 
and practices that generate this wealth. And that is their prerogative.</P>
<P>But the life-shaping force haunting the world's poor is not Disneyfication; 
it is not McWorld. Nor is it a Nike or a Shell, whatever its other sins may have 
been. Nor, indeed, is it the WTO, the World Bank or the IMF, though each has 
committed egregious policy errors over the years.</P>
<P>The stark reality facing the world's poor is the absence of economic 
opportunity, a deep-rooted inability to generate equitable and sustainable 
economic growth, and a scarcity of the political, economic and social 
institutions conducive to that outcome.</P>
<P>This root problem is compounded by an insufficient sense of global solidarity 
in the form of faster and deeper debt relief, greater market access for the 
exports of developing countries, especially the least developed, and vastly 
expanded programs of outright grants to poor countries, targeted for poverty 
reduction programs.</P>
<P>Rejectionism will not solve a single one of those problems. Globalization can 
help do so a globalization that is embedded in universal values and principles, 
and one that is better managed by good governance" at national and international 
levels alike.</P>
<P>That is our agenda expressed, most recently, in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration, adopted by our heads of state and government at the Millennium 
Summit in September, and reflecting the priorities laid out by the 
Secretary-General in his Millennium Report, We the Peoples.</P>
<P>We invite all of you to work with us in making this agenda a reality.</P>
<P>Thank you</P>
