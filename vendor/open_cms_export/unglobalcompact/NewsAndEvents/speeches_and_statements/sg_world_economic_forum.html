          <H1>The Secretary-General - Address to the World Economic Forum</H1>
<H2>New York, 4 February 2002</H2>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, <BR>It's good to be back in New 
York, and to find all of you here.</P>
<P>Even in the dark days of last September, I was confident that this great city 
would soon recover its traditional verve and vibrancy. I am so glad that Klaus 
Schwab shared my confidence – and your presence here this weekend shows that we 
were both right.</P>
<P>My message to you is still the same as it was in Davos last year, and even 
three years ago. But I believe it has gained greater urgency.</P>
<P>Two months ago, I had the honour to deliver the Nobel Lecture in Oslo. I 
began by asking my audience to imagine what life is like, and what it holds in 
store, for a girl born in today's Afghanistan – though I might equally well have 
mentioned a baby boy or girl in Sierra Leone, or in the poorest parts of almost 
any developing country.</P>
<P>I reminded them that the life of that girl, and of hundreds of millions of 
her contemporaries, would be lived under conditions that many of them in that 
audience would consider inhuman.</P>
<P>It that was true for that audience, it is surely even more so for you here 
today.</P>
<P>Perhaps no one in this hall feels as rich, or as powerful and influential, as 
he or she is perceived to be by others. And yet I believe all of you – whether 
you are business leaders, political leaders or opinion leaders – know well that 
you are enormously privileged, compared to the great majority of your fellow 
human beings, both in your standard of living and in the power and influence 
that you wield.</P>
<P>You all know that you are sharing this small planet with well over a billion 
people who are denied the very minimum requirements of human dignity, and with 
four or five billion whose choices in life are narrow indeed compared to yours. 
In fact the planet seems to many of us more and more like a small boat driven by 
a fierce gale through dark and uncharted waters, with more and more people 
crowded on board, hoping desperately to survive.</P>
<P>None of us, I suggest, can afford to ignore the condition of our fellow 
passengers on this little boat. If they are sick, all of us risk infection. And 
if they are angry, all of us can easily get hurt.</P>
<P>Our problem is one of reality multiplied by perception.</P>
<P>The reality is that power and wealth in this world are very, very unequally 
shared, and that far too many people are condemned to lives of extreme poverty 
and degradation.</P>
<P>The perception, among many, is that this is the fault of globalisation, and 
that globalisation is driven by a global elite, composed of – or at least, 
represented by – the people who attend this gathering.</P>
<P>That perception is not universal, but it is widely shared – especially in 
places like Argentina and East Asia, which have recent experience of severe 
financial crises, but also by an increasingly vocal section of public opinion in 
the developed world.</P>
<P>Do not underestimate the attraction of the rival gathering, timed to coincide 
with yours, that has just finished in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Its title, "World 
Social Forum" is intended as a criticism of yours, implying that you are 
interested "only" in economics, or in profit, and that you do not care about the 
social effects of your economic activities. And that criticism resonates around 
the world.</P>
<P>I believe that perception is wrong – and that globalisation, so far from 
being the cause of poverty and other social ills, offers the best hope of 
overcoming them. But it is up to you to prove it wrong, with actions that 
translate into concrete results for the downtrodden, exploited and excluded.</P>
<P>It is not enough to say – though it is true – that without business the poor 
would have no hope of escaping their poverty. Too many of them have no hope as 
it is.</P>
<P>You must show that economics, properly applied, and profits, wisely invested, 
can bring social benefits within reach not only for the few but for the many, 
and eventually for all.</P>
<P>Some of the business leaders among you may respond that that is not the 
business of business – that your job is only to look after the bottom line, and 
the interests of shareholders. They would argue that social policy is a matter 
for governments, and also that it is up to governments to ensure that more 
people enjoy the benefits of capitalism, by creating a business-friendly climate 
in each country.</P>
<P>Certainly there is much that governments can and must do. I will come to that 
in a moment. But more and more business leaders are realising that they do not 
have to wait for governments to do the right thing, and indeed they cannot 
afford to. In many cases, governments only find the courage and resources to do 
the right thing when business takes the lead.</P>
<P>I am glad to say that many business leaders have responded to the call I 
first made in Davos three years ago, when I proposed the Global Compact. They 
have publicly espoused the nine principles that I set out then – principles 
drawn from international agreements on human rights, labour standards and the 
environment. And we are working, together with the International Confederation 
of Free Trade Unions, and leading non-profit groups that have relevant 
expertise, to help those business leaders ensure that the nine principles are 
really applied in their day-to-day corporate practice.</P>
<P>That is good, but the Global Compact asks for more.</P>
<P>There are many positive ways for business to make a difference in the lives 
of the poor – not through philanthropy, though that is also very important, but 
through initiatives that, over time, will help to build new markets, as well as 
improving the self-respect of the corporations concerned and the respect they 
enjoy in the wider community.</P>
<P>Increasingly, business leaders are recognising that there are many small and 
poor countries in which they do not invest enough – not because these countries 
are badly governed or have unfriendly policies, but simply because they are too 
small and poor to be interesting markets or to become major producers, and 
because they lack the skills, infrastructure and institutions that a successful 
market economy needs. The unpleasant truth is that markets put a premium on 
success, and tend to punish the poor for the very fact that they are poor.</P>
<P>Left alone in their poverty, these countries are all too likely to collapse, 
or relapse, into conflict and anarchy, a menace to their neighbours and 
potentially – as the events of 11 September so brutally reminded us – a threat 
to global security. Yet, taken together, their peoples represent a very large 
potential market – and many of their disadvantages could be offset if 
international business and donor governments adopted a common strategy aimed at 
making them more attractive to investment and ensuring that it reaches them.</P>
<P>Sometimes companies can make a massive difference with really small 
investments. Take the case of the world's salt manufacturers. Working with the 
United Nations, they have made sure that all salt manufactured for human 
consumption contains iodine.</P>
<P>The result is that every year, more than 90 million newborn children are 
protected against iodine deficiency, and thus against a major cause of mental 
retardation.</P>
<P>Let me challenge all of you to follow this example, and think of ways that 
your company can help mobilise global science and technology to tackle the 
interlocking crises of hunger, disease, environmental degradation and conflict 
that are holding back the developing world.</P>
<P>Please join in the Global Health Initiative, which this Forum has been 
discussing over the last few days.</P>
<P>Please work with the new Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, to 
provide at low cost the products developing countries need for disease 
control.</P>
<P>It is a shocking fact that, out of the 1,233 drugs licensed in the world 
between 1975 and 1997, only 13 were for tropical diseases, and only four were 
commercially developed specifically for tropical diseases suffered by human 
beings. We can surely improve on this, now that governments – working with 
foundations and international organisations – are starting to offer venture 
capital for the private sector to develop medicines and vaccines for these 
neglected diseases, on condition that the new compounds are marketed to poor 
countries as close to cost price as possible.</P>
<P>Over the last two years I have seen this differential pricing applied to 
medicines for treating malaria, HIV, TB and sleeping sickness. Now, the new Fund 
should enable many more countries to take advantage of it.</P>
<P>Working together for health is not just a matter of charity. It also makes 
economic sense. A scientific study, led by Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, has now 
proved what many of us from Africa already knew. Investments in the health of 
poor people are a springboard for economic growth, with as much as a six-fold 
return on investment.</P>
<P>And much the same applies to education. In the developed world, companies 
give large amounts of money to universities, not out of charity, but to maintain 
the flow of skilled engineers and scientists that the economy needs. Why not do 
the same in developing countries, where it would make an even greater 
difference?</P>
<P>Once you start thinking creatively along these lines, you will come up with 
ideas much faster than I can. Please bring them to the United Nations 
Development Programme – or to whichever of the various UN funds, programmes and 
agencies is directly involved in your sector. We will be more than happy to help 
you find partners in the developing world.</P>
<P>Initiative and partnership are the two key ingredients of success.</P>
<P>Business needs enlightened partners in government, but it need not wait 
passively for them to appear. In many countries, the voice of business leaders 
plays a very important role in moulding the climate of opinion in which 
governments take their decisions.</P>
<P>And governments do indeed have a decisive role to play, in the months and 
years ahead, in determining whether globalisation really is made to work for the 
poor, or whether, even as it bridges geographical distance, it widens the 
material and psychological distance between the privileged and the 
powerless.</P>
<P>A first, vital test will come as early as next month, with the International 
Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico.</P>
<P>I believe this Conference offers us the best chance we have had, in many 
years, to unlock the financial resources that are so desperately needed for 
development. I believe tangible results are possible.</P>
<P>It is essentially up to the governments of the world to prove me right, and 
the sceptics wrong.</P>
<P>On the one hand, the Conference must strengthen and sharpen the consensus 
that now exists on the policies, mechanisms and institutional frameworks 
required, in developing countries, to mobilise domestic resources, and to 
attract and benefit from international private investment. In particular, there 
should be agreement to conclude a comprehensive international convention against 
corruption, providing, for example, for the repatriation of illicitly 
transferred funds.</P>
<P>But at the same time there must be real movement forward on four key issues 
that are of vital importance to all developing countries: trade, aid, debt, and 
the management of the global economy.</P>
<P>On trade, an event of great promise occurred in Doha last November, with the 
agreement to open a new round of negotiations that will address the concerns of 
developing countries. But so far, it is only a promise. We need results. The 
developed countries must negotiate in good faith, to stop flooding the world 
market with subsidised farm exports, to the detriment of developing countries, 
and to open their own markets to labour-intensive products from those 
countries.</P>
<P>But even when a door is opened, you cannot walk through it without leg 
muscles. So, as trade barriers are removed, we must make sure that developing 
countries receive the assistance they need to develop their infrastructure and 
capacities.</P>
<P>We need at least an extra $50 billion of official development assistance each 
year if we are to reach the Millennium development goals, including the halving 
of extreme poverty in the world by 2015, to which all the world's governments 
have committed themselves. That means doubling the present figure for ODA – 
which may sound ambitious, but would still leave us well short of the recognised 
goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for all donor countries. I still 
see no good reason why the Monterrey Conference should not adopt that extra $50 
billion as an immediate, short-term target, to be achieved within two or three 
years.</P>
<P>It should also be the occasion for creditor countries to give a clear 
commitment to implement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative fully and 
promptly, and indeed to go beyond it so that from now on the debts of those 
countries become truly sustainable. And something also needs to be done to 
ensure more equitable burden-sharing in financial crises involving middle-income 
countries, as in the recent tragic case of Argentina.</P>
<P>Finally, all these issues can no longer be settled in private conclave among 
the rich and powerful. The developing countries have as a big a stake as anyone 
in the future of the world economy. Their views should count for something when 
decisions affecting it are taken. The Monterrey Conference should be the 
occasion for those who currently wield the greatest influence to show that they 
are taking this subject seriously.</P>
<P>I am glad to say that many business leaders are showing a great interest in 
this Conference, and playing an active part in the preparations for it. I hope 
they will make a big effort between now and then to ensure that their 
governments take it equally seriously. No one is better placed than they are to 
refute the arguments of protectionists and penny-pinchers, making a persuasive 
case for genuinely open markets and more generous official assistance.</P>
<P>My friends,<BR>I think we all have a sense today of having come to a 
turning-point in history. We felt that already with the end of the cold war and 
the beginning of a new millennium – and then, last September, we found ourselves 
entering that new millennium through a gate of fire, such as none of us ever 
wished to see.</P>
<P>The forces of envy, despair and terror in today's world are stronger than 
many of us realised. But they are not invincible. Against them, we must bring a 
message of solidarity, of mutual respect and, above all, of hope.</P>
<P>Business cannot afford to be seen as the problem. It must, working with 
government, and with all the other actors in society, be part of the 
solution.</P>
<P>Let that message go out today, from this stricken but indomitable city, and 
let us make it heard throughout the whole world.</P>
<P>Thank you very much.</P>
