          <H1>African Enterprises and The Global Compact: Adding Value through Human 
Relationships</H1>
<H2>by Dr David F. Murphy, New Academy of Business in association 
with the African Institute of Corporate Citizenship</H2>
<H2>Tunis, Tunisia, 10-12 May 2001</H2>
<H3><INTRODUCTION></H3>
<P>When the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan invited 
the international business community in January 1999 to enter into a global 
compact with the UN and civil society, he articulated a vision of a more 
sustainable and just world with partnership as its cornerstone. More than two 
years later, some 300 enterprises worldwide have lent their support to the 
Global Compact and the core values embodied in its nine principles covering 
human rights, labour standards and environmental practices. Together with the UN 
Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and the UN Environment Programme, more than 10 leading 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and labour groups are actively supporting 
the Global Compact process internationally. International Organization of 
Employers, International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, Amnesty 
International, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, IUCN, 
WWF-International, World Resources Institute, International Institute for 
Environment and Development, Regional International Networking Group, World 
Business Council on Sustainable Development, Prince of Wales International 
Business Leaders Forum, and Business for Social Responsibility.</P>
<P>The purpose of this paper is to stimulate discussion with African employers 
about the role and relevance of the Global Compact for African enterprises, 
particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the informal sector. 
Furthermore, the paper will explore specific strategies and initiatives that 
individual African enterprises can undertake within their spheres of influence 
to lend support to the Global Compact.</P>
<P>Consistent with the partnership principles embodied in the Global Compact, 
this paper has been prepared by the New Academy of Business in association with 
the African Institute of Corporate Citizenship (AICC). The New Academy works 
with entrepreneurs, managers, educators, activists and policy makers to produce 
educational activities and resources on the social, ethical and environmental 
dimensions of business practice. AICC is committed to leading Africa's corporate 
citizenship practice and debate through its work with African companies and by 
stimulating and supporting public debate. The New Academy and AICC are currently 
collaborating with UN Volunteers (UNV) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) 
on a new initiative aimed at enhancing business-community relations in eight 
countries, including Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa.</P>
<H3>Setting the Context</H3>
<P>The title of this paper 'African Enterprises and the Global 
Compact: Adding Value through Human Relationships' was inspired by the thinking 
and writing of Léopold Sédar Senghor, the former Poet-President of Senegal:</P>
<P>In African society, technical activities are always linked with cultural and 
religious activities, with art and magic, if not with the realm of the mystical. 
In technical activities and especially in productive labour, all these have an 
important part to play. We are dealing with a society based essentially on human 
relationships... Senghor (1976), p. 34.</P>
<P>Born in 1906 in the village of Joal on Senegal's coast, Senghor was the son 
of a trader and became the first African to qualify to teach in French lycées 
and universities. He went on to have a distinguished career in education, 
poetry, the military and politics. The wisdom of Senghor lies in his capacity to 
articulate the contribution of African values to global understanding. For 
Senghor, the fundamental importance of 'human relationships' in Africa 
transforms technical transactions such as commerce and productive labour into 
more meaningful interactions based on cooperation, respect and joy. Writing in 
1959, Senghor recalls a discussion with a Dakar industrialist who:</P>
<P>complained to me a few years ago that he did not get the same output from his 
workers as in France. I told him to feed them well, train them well and let them 
sing at work. He took my advice and he did not have to wait for results. Senghor 
(1976), p. 79.</P>
<P>The central importance of positive human relationships between employers and 
workers lies at the heart of the Global Compact principles, which advocate 
business support for international human rights and fundamental rights at 
work.</P>
<P>Senghor's vision of bringing African values to the rest of the world also 
embodies the principles of sustainable development implicit in the Global 
Compact:</P>
<P>It is not a case of reviving the past so as to live in an African museum. It 
is a case of animating this world, here and now, with the values that come from 
our past .... First of all there is no question of denying the industrial world. 
It is obvious that [we] ... must create an economic infrastructure and 
industries.... But [we] must be careful, during this transformation of the 
environment, to adapt [our] methods to the reality of the soil, climate and 
people. Senghor (1976), pp. 78-79.</P>
<P>Although Senghor's words date back to 1959, what he is essentially saying 
isthey remind us that economic development needs to encompass the precautionary 
approach, environmental responsibility and environmentally friendly 
technologies, the three environmental principles in the Global Compact.</P>
<P>The essence of the Global Compact is a call for joint action by business, 
civil society and the UN based on shared values and learning. African 
enterprises and their social partners have an important roles to play in this 
process and in Africa's ongoing development. The quest for mutually beneficial 
human relationships represents the essence of the Global Compact. Ensuring that 
enterprise activities in Africa are compatible with both social and ecological 
needs is what the Global Compact process is all about.</P>
<P>What are the main challenges facing the Global Compact in Africa? Why is the 
Global Compact relevant to African enterprises, in particular SMEs and 
microenterprises? How can enterprise performance be linked to the Global Compact 
principles? Finally, what are we asking African enterprises to do tomorrow? In 
our discussions at this conference, we will have many opportunities to consider 
these and other important questions. This paper represents a preliminary attempt 
to explore this agenda and to stimulate discussion about the role and relevance 
of The Global Compact for African enterprises. Léopold Senghor reminds us that 
"co-operation ... has always been held in honour in Africa." Senghor (1976), p. 
100. In the spirit of Senghor, let us work together to make the Global Compact 
work for Africa.</P>
<H3>Challenges for the Global Compact in Africa</H3>
<P>As we begin to map an agenda for the Global Compact in Africa, 
it is important to consider the economic opportunities and constraints facing 
African enterprises in their efforts to integrate principles on human rights, 
labour standards and environmental sustainability into their core business 
practices.</P>
<P>Africa's economy as a whole and indeed the various regional and national 
economies of the continent evoke many contrasting images. A recent cover story 
in The Economist entitled 'Africa's Elusive Dawn' paints a picture of hopeless, 
general gloom:</P>
<P>Who will mend Africa? That it is in trouble is hardly in doubt. Seven or 
eight of its countries are convulsed by insurgencies, half a dozen more are 
involved in the war in the Congo, several others suffer recurrent ethnic 
clashes.... Just as worrying, many of the countries that have escaped such 
fighting are floundering economically. Half of sub-Saharan Africa's 600m people 
live on just 65 cents a day, and recently they have been getting poorer. Such 
facts promoted prompted us last year to call Africa "the hopeless continent"... 
The Economist (2001), p. 17.</P>
<P>Now let us contrast the portrayal of Africa by The Economist with one found 
in a book by Justin F. Beckett and Michael E.M. Sudarkasa published in 2000 
called Investing in Africa:</P>
<P>Since the early 1990s the number of African investor success stories has 
increased dramatically... Although the African continent has long been dismissed 
as economically insignificant, recent success stories have prompted investors to 
take a closer look...Investors are examining this vast region of over 11 million 
square miles and over 750 million people and judging the economies of Africa's 
53 independent countries on their own merits... Instead of giving due attention 
to the positive political and economic transformations that are taking place on 
the continent, the majority of the stories and pictures highlight Africa's 
shortcomings. Beckett and Sudarkasa (2000), pp. 18-19.</P>
<P>Beckett and Sudarkasa reveal that in the second half of the 1990s Africa had 
the world's top performing stock markets and that the continent has given birth 
to the most new stock markets in the past decade. While acknowledging that most 
of Africa's national and regional economies have real shortcomings, the authors 
insist that "the information that is disseminated about Africa ... consistently 
presents Africa from a glass-is-half-empty perspective." Beckett and Sudarkasa 
(2000), p. 19. The root of the problem is that most African countries 
historically have not had the financial and technical capacity "to present their 
own images to the world." Global media images of Africa are still largely shaped 
by the interpretations of former colonialists. Africa's colonial legacy 
therefore continues to influence contemporary perceptions of the continent's 
economic, social and political progress.</P>
<P>Let us now take a brief look at the prospects for the Global Compact on the 
continent by looking at relevant historical and current trends.</P>
<H3>The Legacies of Colonialism and ApartheidPre-Independence Perspectives</H3>

<P>Most African countries share similar economic structures because they largely 
have a common history. Until the beginning of the 20th century African economies 
could predominantly be characterized as subsistence agriculture using 
traditional farming methods. Isolated, but vibrant, trading economies did 
however exist along Africa's west and east coasts, on trans-Saharan routes, and 
in Cape Town.</P>
<P>Africa's trading heritage is also evident in the continent's ubiquitous local 
markets which have been lively places of commercial activity for centuries. 
Throughout Africa, market traders and their customers continue to gather to 
negotiate mutually acceptable, fair prices for goods and services. Engaging sole 
traders and enterprises from this predominantly informal sector in the Global 
Compact process will be a major challenge. The Global Compact has the potential 
to build upon the human relationships of traditional marketplaces and encourage 
African traders to provide workers and the environment with their own 'fair 
deals'.</P>
<P>The advent of colonial rule in Africa brought with it three powerful, 
tradition-shattering ideas which have had a dramatic influence on traditional 
economic, political and institutional structures and which have remained, 
despite years of African independence (Todaro, 1994, p. 34). Concepts such as 
private property and personal taxation and the idea that tax should be paid in 
money and not in kind, served to erode the autonomy of local communities and 
exposed communities to new forms of exploitation. In order to pay their tax, 
many Africans were forced to seek work in mines, on plantations and farms or in 
towns and provided a cheap form of labour. This loss of local tradition and the 
shift from rural to urban forms of productive labour are among many colonial 
legacies that will influence contemporary efforts to promote the Global Compact 
principles.</P>
<P>While colonialism shaped the structure of most African countries, Apartheid 
determined the structure of the South African economy. The policy of segregation 
and job-reservation for whites disempowered the Black, Indian and Coloured 
communities in South Africa which make up the vast majority of the population. 
Despite current efforts to promote black empowerment, much work remains to be 
done to overcome South Africa's history of segregation and discrimination.</P>
<P>Another major legacy of the colonial era can be found in Africa's history of 
supplying raw materials to Europe and the emergence of dual economies. While a 
'modern' economy developed around primary production of agricultural products 
and mineral extraction and which was largely export focused and controlled by 
large corporations, the majority of Africans continued to live and work in the 
traditional subsistence agricultural economy. A legacy of colonialism that still 
remains today is that government administration is largely focused on the urban 
areas and generally does not extend to the rural areas (Herbst, 1996). The 
implication for the Global Compact is that dissemination of the programme to 
businesses operating in rural areas can prove difficult without an existing 
administrative infrastructure.</P>
<P>Within their spheres of influence, African enterprises are well placed to 
support community and civil society efforts to protect and uphold human rights, 
worker welfare and environmental protection. The Global Compact offers African 
business leaders a powerful tool to promote human rights and anti-discrimination 
policies in the workplace. There would also appear to be considerable scope for 
using one of the Global Compact's forums – the Global Issues Dialogue – to 
address the impact of the colonial and Apartheid legacies on contemporary 
efforts to implement the Global Compact principles.</P>
<H3>Post-Independence Transitions</H3>
<P>By 1970 most African countries had achieved political 
independence, however, their economies had largely been structured to provide 
cheap raw materials to northern industrialized countries while serving as 
markets for more expensive, value-added manufactured products, goods and 
services. In an attempt at greater self-reliance many African countries 
(including Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania) embarked on import substitution 
policies aimed at developing local capacity to produce their required 
manufactured products (Todaro, 1994). In addition, the period following 
independence was characterized by large-scale nationalization of commercial 
enterprises to reduce the amount of foreign ownership and outflows of capital. 
Both policies largely failed to meet economic growth and development challenges. 
Despite "a decade of relatively satisfactory growth" from the mid 1960s to the 
mid 1970s, UNCTAD notes that</P>
<P>economic performance worsened in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
in the second half of the 1970s; with few exceptions, the region as a whole 
experienced thereafter two decades of almost continuous economic decline. UNCTAD 
(1999), p. 1.</P>
<P>During this period, large-scale borrowing from international financial 
institutions to finance investments into the necessary resources and 
infrastructure for growth and development led most countries to become heavily 
indebted.</P>
<P>In South Africa, as international trade boycotts and sanctions intensified 
during the 1980s to protest against the Apartheid system, the country moved 
towards even greater self-sufficiency with a large amount of government support 
being channelled towards commercial farmers and strengthening the industrial and 
manufacturing sector. While a modern economy, with a well-developed 
infrastructure, was created around these activities and financed largely by the 
country's mineral wealth, the non-white population was increasingly 
marginalized.</P>
<P>While Apartheid managed to create a supply of cheap black labour for its 
labour intensive economy for almost 40 years, this eventually contributed to the 
breakdown of the system. Labour unions became increasingly organized and 
sophisticated; mass action by the disgruntled workforce became common practice 
and threatened to bring the economy to a halt. The role of the trade unions in 
eventually ending Apartheid has had a significant influence on the development 
of highly progressive labour legislation in the new democratic South Africa.</P>
<P>Most other African countries had to service their growing debts and 
consequently faced international pressure to increase their production of export 
goods, reduce the amount of foreign imports, cut back on education and 
health-care spending and in many cases to take out further loans. The demand for 
the latter led the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote 
structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) in the 1980s which aimed to stabilize 
economies. Adoption and adherence to these programmes, including trade 
liberalization, greater deregulation and privatization of enterprises, became a 
prerequisite for securing additional loans. SAPs have, however, been widely 
criticized as their short-term solutions to the balance-of-payments problems 
have compounded pre-existing long-term development problems, impacting 
negatively on the most vulnerable sectors of the economy – the rural poor.</P>
<P>The extent of poverty and the inequality between rich and poor in most 
countries has shown no sign of diminishing. Declining commodity prices for key 
African exports have exacerbated the economic situation. A recent UNCTAD study 
notes that "hardly any country in the region has successfully completed its 
adjustment programme with a return to sustained growth." UNCTAD (1999) p. 1. 
Within such an economic context, the adoption by African enterprise of the 
Global Compact Principles poses considerable challenges. Without substantial and 
sustained economic recovery and debt relief in Africa, there may be limited 
scope for business and government leadership on human rights, labour standards 
and environmental issues. The Global Compact nonetheless has the potential to 
mobilize joint action by African leaders in government, business and civil 
society aimed at finding new solutions to Africa's ongoing economic problems. By 
working together at both the global and local levels, Africa's political, 
economic and social leaders can demonstrate their commitment to sustained 
economic recovery and debt relief within the context of the Global Compact 
process.</P>
<H3>Signs of Recovery</H3>
<P>Beginning in 1995, Africa began to experience an increase in 
per capita income. By 1998-99, per capita GNP in Sub-Saharan Africa was again in 
negative growth (World Bank, 2001). Despite ongoing debt servicing problems, 
policies toward greater privatisation have resulted in foreign direct investment 
(FDI) in Sub-Saharan Africa increasing more than five-fold for the period 
1990-1998 from $834 million to $4,364 million (World Bank, 2001). These figures 
do, however, hide differences in the allocation of FDI both between and within 
countries, with the majority of finances going towards the primary sector and 
resource-based manufacturing (Heymans, 1996). The growing presence of foreign 
investors in Africa has also brought large-scale restructuring and retrenchments 
in many countries. Throughout the continent, there remains a need to support the 
development of SMEs and microenterprises to reduce high levels of unemployment. 
Integrating the Global Compact principles into enterprise development strategies 
should become a priority for technical assistance programmes in Africa.</P>
<P>Not denying the many political and economic problems that persist in many 
parts of Africa, some countries are successfully linking international 
competitiveness with human development. Published by the World Economic Forum in 
January 2001, The Africa Competitiveness Report surveyed 1,800 foreign companies 
in 24 African states whose combined GDP accounts for 80% of the continent's 
total GDP. The survey ranked Tunisia and Mauritius as the top two African 
countries in both competitiveness and development. These two countries combine 
economic openness with good governance, sound finances and well-developed 
infrastructure. They also share Africa's highest life expectancy of 70 years and 
its lowest infant mortality rates at less than 30 per 1,000 births. See Versi 
(2001).</P>
<P>Tunisia and Mauritius are not alone in linking economic 
and social progress. Other countries ranking in Africa's top 10 for both 
international competitiveness and human development include Botswana, Namibia, 
Morocco, Egypt, South Africa and Ghana. Specific findings of The Africa 
Competitiveness Report reveal why some African countries are becoming more 
attractive locations for foreign and domestic investment. Botswana and Tunisia 
are the only two African countries where corruption is negligible. The most 
comprehensive labour regulations are found in Botswana, Namibia, Morocco, 
Tunisia and Mauritius. Absenteeism from work is insignificant in South Africa, 
Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritius in contrast with Zambia and Malawi where it is 
very marked. As the incidence of HIV/AIDS grows in South Africa and other 
African countries, workplace absenteeism will undoubtedly increase 
significantly. The highest confidence in the banking system lies in Egypt, 
Botswana, South Africa, Tunisia, Mauritius and Morocco. Political stability and 
the most favourable climate for business expansion are highest in Tunisia, 
Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Senegal, Tanzania and Madagascar. Finally, in 
keeping with a key theme of this paper, The Africa Competitiveness Report notes 
that the importance of personal relations in business transactions is strongest 
in Tunisia, Ethiopia, Namibia and Cote d'Ivoire. See Versi (2001). See also <A 
href="http://www.weforum.org" target=_blank>www.weforum.org</A></P>
<P>From the above it is apparent that some African countries have a number of 
the key economic, social and political ingredients in place to enable both 
African and multinational enterprises (MNEs) to begin to implement the 
principles of the Global Compact in Africa. Without economic openness, good 
governance, strong financial and legal institutions, good infrastructure and 
positive social indicators, enterprise development is undermined and 
consequently there is limited capacity for business action on social and 
environmental initiatives. That some African countries clearly meet many of 
these criteria offers considerable scope for enterprise support for the Global 
Compact on the continent.</P>
<P>Despite some of the positive developments noted above, most African countries 
remain minor players in the global economy. For the most part northern 
industrialized countries continue to control the terms of technology transfer, 
private capital and foreign aid flows and, in some cases, establish trade 
barriers to protect their domestic suppliers from cheaper imports. The African 
continent is responsible for less than 2% of world trade. In an effort to 
challenge the dominance of international trade by northern countries, African 
countries are renewing efforts to promote greater regional economic cooperation. 
There is also an increasing recognition amongst African leaders that they cannot 
afford to remain isolated from the global economy. This has led to a general 
trend towards adopting policies that support greater trade liberalization and 
privatization. As many countries are placing greater emphasis on the 
privatization of state enterprises, there is some confusion and uncertainty as 
to the division of responsibilities between government and business in 
protecting human rights and in promoting development (Kapelus, 2001). The lack 
of clarity with respect to who should be responsible hampers progress on all 
fronts related to the Global Compact. Given that the Global Compact is 
essentially about multi-stakeholder collaboration, governments need to work 
together with both the UN and business to clarify roles and responsibilities in 
relation to human rights and development. This renewed African political support 
for open markets and enterprise development provides an opportunity for the 
Global Compact process on the continent. Increasingly the success of 
public-private partnerships for economic development depends upon the inclusion 
of social and environmental principles and practices.</P>
<P>Alongside growing enthusiasm for partnerships such as the Global Compact, 
some concerns are being raised about the potential pitfalls of UN, government 
and civil society collaboration with business on social and environmental 
initiatives. For example, Peter Utting of the UN Research Institute for Social 
Development (UNRISD) argues that "various UN institutions appear to be paying 
insufficient attention to certain risks associated with partnerships, including 
conflicts of interest, self-censorship, the poor choice of partners and the 
tarnishing of the UN's reputation." Utting (2000), p. 1. With some parts of 
global civil society increasingly raising questions about globalization and the 
power of corporations, there is a danger that the Global Compact process could 
lose credibility within Africa before it has a chance to gain sufficient 
momentum. African enterprises, governments and civil society will need to work 
together with the UN to ensure that the Global Compact process in Africa is 
inclusive, transparent and results-oriented.</P>
<H3>Millennium Africa Recovery Plan</H3>
<P>The most recent development on the African continent which 
reflects new political and economic thinking, and which may influence the 
success of the Global Compact in Africa, is the announcement of the Millenium 
Africa Recovery Plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2001.</P>
<P>The Millennium Africa Plan, endorsed by, amongst others, the leaders of South 
Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, Senegal and Algeria, signals a recognition that 
Africa cannot isolate itself from the globalisation process any longer and must 
work to harness the positive aspects of this process to meet its development 
objectives (Mazwai, 2001). The concept of the plan was presented as a "work 
still in progress." Leaders of the project are Thabo Mbeki, South African 
president and chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement; Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigerian 
president and chairperson of the Group of 77 countries in the Southern 
Hemisphere; and Abdelazis Bouteflika, president of Algeria and chairman of the 
Organization of African Unity. Following the unanimous approval of African 
leaders at the OAU Libya summit at the end of February, the plan will now be 
transformed into a concrete programme of action in time for the G8 Summit in 
Italy in July this year (SABC, 2001). Participating leaders are to form a 
compact committing them to the programme and a forum of leaders are to make 
decisions about sub-programmes and initiatives and review progress on its 
implementation.</P>
<P>Key objectives of the Plan and its associated programmes that are most 
relevant to the Global Compact process include (Enterprise, 2001):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Promoting and protecting democracy and human rights 
  by developing clear standards of accountability, transparency and 
  participatory governance at national and sub-national levels</LI><LI>Creating peace, security and stability</LI><LI>Strengthening Africa's capacity for the prevention, 
  mediation and resolution of conflicts</LI><LI>Instituting transparent legal and regulatory 
  frameworks for financial markets, the auditing of private companies, the 
  public and infrastructure sector</LI><LI>Investing in human resources</LI><LI>Increasing investment in the information and 
  communication technology sector in order to bridge the digital divide</LI><LI>Eradicating poverty and enhancing the quality of life</LI><LI>Revitalising and extending the provision of education 
  and health services, with high priority being given to tackling HIV/AIDS</LI><LI>Developing and implementing policies that raise the 
  quality and quantity of basic service delivery (provision of water, sanitation 
  and health services)</LI><LI>Promoting awareness campaigns to combat disease</LI><LI>Rotecting the physical environment</LI><LI>Promoting sustainable development</LI><LI>Achieving debt relief</LI></UL>
<P>It is envisaged that the plan will eventually include both pan-African and 
regional programmes. For example, continent-wide programmes will tackle conflict 
prevention and eradication of infectious diseases, whereas economic initiatives 
will be developed and run at regional levels. President Thabo Mbeki has 
described the Millennium Africa Recovery Plan as being qualitatively different 
from other development plans because Africa's political leadership is taking 
responsibility on its own shoulders to ensure that the "continent actually 
breaks out of its conditions of poverty and underdevelopment." Woza Internet 
(2001)</P>
<P>The Millennium Africa plan promotes global partnerships between Africa and 
other parts of the world and between the public and the private sector. Based on 
shared self-interest, these partnerships have the potential to develop 
infrastructure, agro-industry, tourism and human resources and to promote urban 
renewal and rural development. The main difference between the Millennium Africa 
Plan and previous development plans is that this is the first Africa-led 
revitalization of the continent in which the rest of the world can contribute as 
partners, not donors (Mazwai, 2001). For example, partnerships between 
government and the investing community in the building of roads, airports, dams 
and extending telecommunication networks could be tied to the skills development 
of the population and provide benefits to all parties.</P>
<P>By recognizing that economic rights and environmental sustainability are 
central issues to development, the Millennium Africa Plan has close links to the 
Global Compact. African enterprises will undoubtedly play a central role in the 
recovery process. Their role will be enhanced by adopting the Global Compact 
principles and by collaborating with the UN, governments and civil society 
towards Africa's sustainable human development.</P>
<H3>The HIV/AIDS Challenge</H3>
<P>There is perhaps no other problem facing African enterprises, 
governments and civil society more challenging than the social and economic 
consequences of HIV/AIDS on the continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
estimates that two out of three people living with HIV worldwide – almost 25 
million – are in Sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, nearly 4 million people 
have been infected with HIV since the first case was identified in 1982 and this 
figure is expected to peak at 6 million by 2010. One business analyst in South 
Africa insists that</P>
<P>there is no way that an epidemic of this magnitude, concentrated in the 
country's 15-49 year olds, can fail to be significant for employers. As workers, 
as recipients of company benefits, as consumers, and as parents of the next 
generation, their role in the economy is critical. Van der Vliet (1999), p. 
2.</P>
<P>With HIV now endemic in most of Africa, Jeffrey O'Malley of the International 
HIV/AIDS Alliance emphasises the "need to integrate prevention and care into 
almost every aspect of public and private life" in the most seriously affected 
regions. In this regard, business has "an essential role to play ... in 
different kinds of partnerships with governments and communities." O'Malley 
(1998).</P>
<P>In proposing a global business agenda for HIV/AIDS, UN Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan has identified three key challenges for the private sector:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Eliminate prejudice and discrimination: involve the 
  workforce and their families in developing initiatives to end prejudice and 
  discrimination against those affected by HIV/AIDS. Allow people with HIV/AIDS 
  to continue working thereby enabling them to continue being useful members of 
  society.</LI><LI>Reach out to communities: through programmes that 
  protect and empower communities where companies operate. Prevent the spread of 
  HIV/AIDS in the workplace and beyond by spreading HIV/AIDS awareness and by 
  distributing condoms.</LI><LI>Develop a global perspective: by considering the wider implications of the 
  worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic. Join forces with UN and government agencies, NGOs 
  and others at the forefront of efforts to fight HIV/AIDS.</LI></UL>
<P>There is a clear role for African enterprises to educate their workforces 
about HIV and to become active partners in initiatives to stop the spread of the 
virus. In the words of Kofi Annan: "The struggle against AIDS is a commercial 
imperative - it makes good business sense." Annan (1999). The link between the 
Global Compact principles and the business response to HIV/AIDS in Africa is 
obvious. The right of African workers to be protected from discrimination in the 
workplace and the wider human rights of African people are clearly threatened by 
inappropriate business and societal responses to HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, the 
central role of partnership between the UN, business, government and civil 
society lies at the heart of both the Global Compact process and existing UN 
initiatives on HIV/AIDS.</P>
<H3>The Global Compact and African Enterprises</H3>
<P>The success of the Global Compact internationally depends upon 
action by multinational enterprises (MNEs) as well as by national and local 
enterprises of different sizes. Operating within the context of economic 
globalization, all business activities in Africa rely upon, for their future 
success, strong domestic markets as well as buoyant trade both regionally and 
globally. However, open markets do not operate in a social vacuum. Their 
survival ultimately depends upon shared values and principles. In this section, 
we explore the relevance of the Global Compact for African enterprises and 
review various examples of enterprise practices that support the Global Compact 
principles.</P>
<P>As awareness has developed of the scope and range of business impacts through 
globalization, there has been growing attention given to the social, 
environmental and ethical dimensions of business practice. With business 
activities becoming more global and complex, new and greater demands for 
enhanced business transparency and accountability are being placed on companies 
by a wider range of stakeholders. Examples of business stakeholders include: 
employees, shareholders, trade unions, suppliers, sub-contractors, government 
agencies, local communities, NGOs, multilateral organizations, religious 
organizations, the media, academic institutions, and various other internal and 
external interest groups. In order to balance competing stakeholder interests in 
a rapidly changing world, businesses need to work differently. Such challenges 
are particularly difficult for MNEs with local operations in Africa and other 
regions with developing and transitional economies. The Global Compact 
represents one of many learning tools to enable MNEs, national and local 
enterprises to respond more effectively to these new social and environmental 
challenges. By lending their support to the Global Compact, African enterprises 
will be joining a growing international business movement that is embracing 
shared values and commitments globally and locally.</P>
<H3>The Role of Small and Microenterprises</H3>
<P>Given their crucial role in Africa's national economies, 
small-scale and micro enterprise Also known as the informal small-scale business 
sector. In 1972, the ILO described Africa's informal sector as "small-scale 
(size), labor intensive and low skill nature, low wage, producing goods and 
services for low income people and generally living off the crumbs of the large 
scale formal sector" (ILO, 1972, p. 223). participation in the Global Compact 
process is of particular importance. In Uganda, micro- and small-scale 
enterprises employ about 70 percent of the non-agricultural labour force, 
produce 80 percent of manufactured output and are responsible for 20 percent of 
the country's total GDP. See Koop et al (2000), pp. 55-76. In Zimbabwe, 860,000 
microenterprises employ about 25 percent of the country's working population. 
See Frese, Krauss and Friedrich (2000), pp. 103-130. Various studies on the 
micro- and small enterprise sector in Ghana agree that it employs more people 
than the formal sector. See Empretec Ghana Foundation (2001). Furthermore, 
recent research suggests that the number of Africans working in the micro- and 
small-scale enterprise sector "is about double that of those employed in the 
official large-scale enterprises, including the public sector." See Mead and 
Liedholm (1998). Cited in Frese (2000), p. 4.</P>
<P>While small-scale and microenterprises undoubtedly make important 
contributions to Africa's societies and economies, they generally face real 
limits in terms of growth potential. Only 20 percent of microenterprises 
actually experience growth. Major constraints to growth include access to 
capital, managerial skills and a hostile environment. Cited in Frese (2000). The 
owners and managers of small and microenterprises face day-to-day struggles to 
stay in business. Questions about human rights, labour standards and 
environmental protection do not appear to be among their immediate priorities. 
How then can we convince the owners and managers of Africa's numerous SMEs and 
microenterprises of the added value of adopting the Global Compact 
principles?</P>
<P>The key may lie in building upon African cultural values that share common 
ground with the Global Compact's commitment to partnership. Research on culture 
in Africa consistently reveals that collectivism is highly valued. Cited in 
Frese (2000).</P>
<P>African societies score high on collectivism. In collectivist cultures, 
people form strong and close groups, often evolving around kinship. These groups 
provide lifelong protection in return of unconditional loyalty. Loyalty implies 
that the groups share the means of support.... Positive influences of 
collectivism could be that we-group members help each other financially and 
we-group contacts are useful, both in penetrating a market and in providing 
support when things get tough. Frese and De Kruif (2000), p. 7.</P>
<P>There is considerable potential for African small and microenterprises to 
respond collectively to the Global Compact principles. Experience with 
micro-finance or micro-credit schemes in Africa, Asia and Latin America may 
offer an appropriate model. Micro-finance is essentially about making it easy 
for poor prospective entrepreneurs to borrow start-up capital, as Khalil Osman 
explains:</P>
<P>Their operations emphasize 'strategic lending', i.e., lending very small 
short-term loans to very poor micro-entrepreneurs. Loan repayment is guaranteed 
by group members collectively and access to future credit or loans is contingent 
on successful repayment. Hence, peer monitoring and the prospect of subsequent 
larger loans act as strong incentives for repayment. Osman (1999), p. 1.</P>
<P>Prominent examples include: the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Bank Rakyat 
Indonesia, the Kenya Rural Enterprise Programme, and Banco Solidario of Bolivia. 
By working together with such schemes, microentrepreneurs bring wider benefits 
to themselves and their communities. African micro- and small-scale enterprises 
could be encouraged to make similar forms of collective commitment to the Global 
Compact principles accompanied by peer support and monitoring. Such schemes 
could be promoted and facilitated by local governments, business service 
providers, NGOs and bilateral and multilateral donors.</P>
<P>Another model of collective social action by small and microenterprises can 
be found in the Pakistan hand-stitched soccer ball industry. Launched in early 
1997, the Project to Eliminate Child Labour in the Pakistan Soccer Ball Industry 
is a partnership initiative that encompasses both labour practice monitoring and 
social protection for displaced child workers and their families. Project 
partners include: the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce, local manufacturers, 
family-owned enterprises, NGOs, the Pakistani Government, global soccer ball 
brands, UNICEF and the ILO. Similar child labour initiatives are now underway in 
various other parts of the world.</P>
<P>The Association of Tanzania Employers (ATE) has an ongoing project to raise 
business and public awareness about the worst forms of child labour, focusing on 
the tea, coffee and sisal industries. Working within the framework of the ILO 
International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), the ATE has 
raised the awareness of plantation owners and managers about the consequences of 
child labour and the importance of safeguarding jobs for adults. In an effort to 
find longer-term solutions to the child labour problem, some employers are 
providing adult employees with financial assistance to set up micro-credit 
schemes and small-scale economic ventures. The aim is to reduce poverty and 
overcome dependence on their children's earnings. ILO (1999). With other East 
African countries beginning to emulate the Tanzanian experience, there is 
potential to build collective enterprise support for the Global Compact 
principles more widely in Africa.</P>
<P>A related strategy of Global Compact promotion to small and microenterprises 
in Africa might be to focus on cultural values and practices that are 
particularly strong in certain countries or regions. Recent research by the 
Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) Research 
Project revealed that Zambians place a high value on the importance of being 
fair, altruistic, generous, caring and kind – characteristics of a society with 
a "humane orientation". Cited in Frese (2000), pp. 8-10. See House (2000). These 
attributes are compatible with both the Global Compact principles and the wider 
African value placed on mutually beneficial human relationships.</P>
<P>The alternative trade movement offers a good example of linking the values of 
fairness and kindness with commercial acumen. The essence of alternative trade 
is that local producers are paid a fair price for their products. Trading 
relationships between the producer and exporter are based on loyalty and mutual 
trust. Alternative trade initiatives are currently active in many parts of 
Africa. For example, Getrade (GH) Ltd. is a Ghanaian export house established in 
1990 that is currently working with over 400 local craftsmen and farmers. 
Getrade promotes the pursuit of artisanal development as a means of achieving 
economic growth and social progress. In realizing it goals, Getrade continually 
strives for fairness in its dealings with all producers, equality in the 
provision of available opportunities and transparency. There could be 
considerable scope for the Global Compact process in Africa to engage artisans, 
community enterprises and cooperatives currently involved in alternative trade 
networks. By working with such enterprises, we would also be actively promoting 
the Global Compact principles. The values embodied in the principles share 
common ground with alternative trade values of economic fairness, equal 
opportunity and local empowerment.</P>
<P>In other parts of Africa, the key to promoting the Global Compact to the 
informal sector could be found in organizations that help to shape cultural 
values and public opinion at the grassroots level such as traditional religious 
or social institutions (e.g., Islamic or Christian groups, youth clubs, women's 
groups, etc.). In order to avoid potential conflicts between national and 
universal values, the key will be to find appropriate entry points and messages 
to promote the Global Compact principles in different cultural and social 
contexts.</P>
<H3>The Role of Medium and Larger Enterprises</H3>
<P>In recent years, the activities of MNEs operating in Africa and 
other parts of the developing world have faced growing public scrutiny. The 
expansion and influence of the Internet and satellite communications have given 
both the international media and global civil society new tools to investigate 
the social and environmental impacts of global companies at the local level. 
From petroleum exploration and extraction to diamond mining and from agriculture 
and tourism to the financial services sector, there has been increasing focus in 
different parts of Africa on the link between enterprise activities and human 
rights, labour standards and the natural environment.</P>
<P>This growing attention to industrial and commercial activities in Africa has 
prompted both MNEs and their African business partners to adopt voluntary social 
and environmental initiatives such as the Global Compact. A good example of MNE 
support for African labour initiatives emerged in 2000, when Barclays Bank and a 
number of African trade unions agreed to the establishment of the Africa-Union 
Forum (AUF) covering 7,000 staff employed by the UK-based multinational bank. 
The Forum is the first African union-employer forum to cover a multinational 
bank. It will meet twice a year and cover staff in seven African countries: 
Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Other examples 
of voluntary social and environmental initiatives include: workplace codes of 
conduct, supply chain audits, social and environmental certification and 
labelling, and other schemes that promote business standards in labour 
practices, human rights, environmental sustainability and other ethical 
matters.</P>
<P>It is not surprising then that supply chain pressure by northern-based MNEs 
has promoted growing numbers of African enterprises to implement voluntary 
social and environmental initiatives. For example, various Southern African 
forestry companies have obtained sustainable forest management certification via 
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) largely as a result of market pressure from 
western European customers. In a related vein, agricultural enterprises in 
different parts of Africa are collaborating with the UK-based Ethical Trading 
Initiative (ETI) primarily because their trading partners in the British food 
retail sector asked them to participate. Although these two initiatives may have 
originated elsewhere, they are nevertheless consistent with the principles 
embodied in the Global Compact. Building upon related social and environmental 
initiatives such as the FSC and ETI represents a potential strategy for 
promoting the Global Compact to African medium and large enterprises that are 
already responding to supply chain pressures.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the growing attention by some MNEs and their African business 
partners to social responsibility issues, the incentive structures of the 
African operation units of most MNEs often mean that limited time and resources 
are directed towards the local implementation of initiatives such as the Global 
Compact. MNEs operate in a high-risk environment with considerable pressure to 
maximize short-term profits. If the Global Compact is to take root in MNEs 
operating in Africa, those responsible for implementation will to need to be 
able to demonstrate how support for such social and environmental causes can 
bring business benefits and contribute to long-term MNE investment in 
Africa.</P>
<P>With local implementation of social initiatives by most MNEs still at an 
early stage in Africa, some African enterprises have begun to question the value 
of the Global Compact and other social initiatives. Dominico Kabyemera of the 
Association of Tanzanian Employers argues that the lack of northern leadership 
represents a major stumbling block towards acceptance and implementation of the 
Global Compact by African enterprises:</P>
<P>With countries like the USA pulling out of the Kyoto protocol [on climate 
change] and others supporting countries that grossly abuse human rights, some 
businessmen here ask themselves whether embracing the Global Compact principles 
too fast may after all be in the best interest of local business. Personal 
communication, 6 April 2001.</P>
<P>Within such a context, the Global Compact runs the risk of being perceived as 
another example of the North imposing social and environmental conditions on the 
trade and commercial activities of the South.</P>
<P>Despite such concerns, there are many examples of locally generated 
enterprise initiatives by African enterprises that share common ground with the 
Global Compact principles. Two areas of focus of particular relevance for the 
African continent are HIV/AIDS and sustainable development.</P>
<P>Growing numbers of African enterprises are responding to the HIV/AIDS 
challenge individually and collectively. In South Africa, Eskom, Anglo Coal and 
other national enterprises have led the HIV/AIDS business response in the 
workplace and wider community. Such South African companies are promoting 
HIV/AIDS education and awareness and implementing anti-discrimination policies 
to protect workers with HIV/AIDS. They are also introducing support programmes 
to care for workers and their families who are affected by HIV/AIDS. Eskom and 
Anglo Coal have received international recognition for their HIV/AIDS workplace 
initiatives. Both companies have received the Global Business Council on 
HIV/AIDS 'Award for Business Excellence in Response to HIV/AIDS'.</P>
<P>Eskom has been an active supporter of the multi-stakeholder Partnership 
Against AIDS in South Africa and has made HIV/AIDS a strategic business 
priority. Eskom endeavours to ensure that every employee fully understand the 
extent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the company programme and how to respond to the 
epidemic as an individual. The company has made a commitment to implement the 
principles of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and non-discrimination and seeks to 
maintain these principles in all of its activities. By working together with the 
South African Government, community organizations and other stakeholders, Eskom 
is playing its part in seeking the effective prevention and elimination of 
HIV/AIDS in South Africa.</P>
<P>Anglo Coal's mines have put in place peer education programmes and various 
other initiatives. Peer educators raise the HIV/AIDS awareness of their fellow 
employees. Anglo Coal's experience is that successful peer education requires 
ongoing support from management and programme administrators. Industrial Theatre 
has been used to disseminate HIV/AIDS policy to mineworkers. This involves the 
use of puppets, plays and other forms of drama. The key messages are that 
workers will not be discriminated against on the basis of their HIV status, and 
that HIV-positive workers will be offered appropriate treatment and support.</P>
<P>In neighbouring Botswana, various enterprises are working together through 
the Botswana Business Council on HIV/AIDS to encourage the local business 
community to take appropriate action on this key human rights and socio-economic 
development issue. Elsewhere on the continent, African enterprises are beginning 
to assume greater responsibility for HIV/AIDS in the workplace. At the same 
time, many challenges lie ahead in efforts to motivate and mobilize African 
enterprises to adopt HIV/AIDS as a strategic priority. Recent research by the 
United Nations Development Programme in South Africa found that less than half 
of companies surveyed ranked HIV/AIDS among their top strategic issues (UNDP, 
1998).</P>
<P>The search for more sustainable forms of development represents another of 
Africa's major challenges. Primary production activities such as mining have 
negative impacts such as acid mine drainage, groundwater pollution and chronic 
illnesses, many of which only surface long after mine closure. Konkola Copper 
Mine plc (KCM) in Zambia's Copperbelt is an example of a mining operation which 
is committed to develop plans for managing its operations and eventual mine 
closure in a way which supports sustainable development. KCM invited key 
stakeholders from the communities, local authorities, civil society and the 
private sector to engage in a consultative forum to discuss issues related to 
the development of the company's social management plans that recognise the 
broader issues relating to local economic development and sustainable 
livelihoods (Khanya, 2000). Issues such as land use and settlement, employment 
and retrenchment, social services, and consultation and public disclosure 
reflect an integration of the concepts of corporate citizenship and the 
promotion of sustainable livelihoods. Through this process, KCM has formally 
recognized the role of stakeholders – an important step towards implementing 
social and environmental principles such as those embodied in the Global 
Compact.</P>
<P>Whether the impetus for social and environmental action by African 
enterprises is external or internal, there is plenty of scope for building upon 
current experience to promote the Global Compact process. With many medium and 
large African enterprises already becoming integrated into to the global 
economy, they will increasingly be expected to develop and implement policies 
related to the environment, labour practices and human rights. For start-ups and 
other young African enterprises, the integration of social, environmental and 
economic principles may provide an impetus for new business opportunities as 
they search for ways of differentiating their products and services in more 
competitive domestic and international markets. Above all, the Global Compact 
invites all African enterprises to join the UN agencies, African governments and 
civil society in re-mapping and re-discovering Africa's development path in the 
21st Century.</P>
<H3>The Global Compact and Enterprise Performance</H3>
<P>Enterprise performance is generally associated with financial 
indicators: sales figures, cash flow, share price, growth rates and profits. 
Owners and managers are expected to be able to make quick decisions to boost the 
economic bottom line performance of their enterprises. Within this context, 
making the business case for initiatives such as the Global Compact is 
particularly challenging. The immediate business results of voluntary social 
initiatives are often difficult if not impossible to measure. There is 
nonetheless growing evidence of the positive link between the economic 
performance of enterprises and social and environmental investments. In this 
section, we explore the potential financial benefits of the Global Compact 
principles for African enterprises.</P>
<P>Let us first take a look at two relevant pieces of research for some possible 
clues. A recent North American study on the interaction between employee 
satisfaction and business results noted:</P>
<P>Despite the rapid and constant rate of change in business today, people 
throughout generations have derived satisfaction from meeting similar needs to 
belong to groups, to feel a sense of accomplishment, to participate in 
organizational and group processes, and decisions, to work cooperatively, to 
fulfill basic physiological needs, to grow and develop, to be recognized and 
acknowledged. Where these needs are met, employees perceive work more 
positively. Both the individual and the organization are able to grow and be 
more successful, thereby providing "wealth" to all stakeholders. Topolosky 
(2000), p. 37.</P>
<P>Using data from a Fortune 100 Company, this six-year study examined the 
relationship between thirty employee satisfaction variables and both corporate 
and business unit financial results. The following employee satisfaction 
variables had the strongest positive relationship to Company financial 
results:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Personal development</LI><LI>Involvement and participation</LI><LI>Use of skills and abilities</LI><LI>Promotion practices</LI><LI>Opportunities for a better job </LI></UL>
<P>The following variables were most negatively correlated with Company 
financial results: satisfaction with corporate change strategies, direction of 
the company, employee benefits, balance between work and personal life, input to 
decisions, job security, and realizing personal benefit from attaining 
organizational goals.</P>
<P>The results of this research suggest that enterprises can reap financial 
rewards by implementing labour practices that make workers happier and more 
productive. The key lesson for the Global Compact process in Africa is that 
enterprise support for international labour standards could bring similar 
business benefits.</P>
<P>European research on the link between productivity, quality and ethics had 
complementary findings. A survey of 480 large organizations, drawn equally from 
the UK, France and Germany, revealed that a majority in all three countries 
agreed that there is an 'added-value' for an organization to behave ethically in 
productivity and quality management. The study concluded that there is 
"undoubtedly a close relationship between productivity, quality and ethics." 
Stainer and Stainer (1995), p. 9. The business case for treating workers better 
is well articulated by the study's researchers Alan and Lorice Stainer:</P>
<P>In order to achieve greater efficiency and high quality, motivating the 
workforce must be a top priority for management. In this way, loyalty towards 
the organization, mutual respect and self-development would be enhanced, thus 
improving job satisfaction and making the management process more effective. 
Stainer and Stainer (1995), p. 6.</P>
<P>African enterprise support for the Global Compact principles has the 
potential to produce similar results. Whether we are talking about motivating 
workers, empowering local communities or protecting essential natural resources, 
the immediate and long-term survival of the enterprise is much more likely when 
good labour, human rights and environmental practices are integrated into core 
business activities.</P>
<P>African enterprises are beginning to reap financial rewards for their social 
and environmental initiatives. In 1999, Macefcoop, a small agricultural 
enterprise in Cameroon became the first African producer to supply organic 
coffee to the growing European fair trade market. Two Tanzanian enterprises 
followed Macefcoop's lead and all three are registered partners of the 
Dutch-based Max Havelaar Foundation, one the Europe's leading fair trade 
organizations. By ensuring that their products are both environmentally and 
socially responsible, these small enterprises are gaining access to key markets 
for their future growth (Harmsen and Bolscher, 1999).</P>
<P>Other examples of flourishing African enterprise initiatives can be found in 
Senegal, Swaziland and Egypt. The alternative tourism Campements Villageois are 
considered to be rural Senegal's most successful economic development project. 
Since their launch in 1974, 19 Campements have been established generating 
annual receipts from tourists of 74 million CFA francs (US$100,000). Campements 
Villageois offer participating rural communities financial rewards while 
ensuring that local values and the natural environment are protected. In 
Swaziland, Fridge Master produces 450,000 annual units of domestic refrigerators 
and freezers with an annual turnover of approximately US$65 million (1996). 
Employing 1200 workers, the company has increased its sales dramatically since 
its move to CFC-free fridges in the early 1990s (Robins and Roberts, 1997). In 
Egypt, Electrostar Refrigerators has embraced " the ozone issue as a valuable 
opportunity to overhaul its production facilities and carve out new markets in 
the Middle East." Robins and Roberts (1997), p. 27. All of the above examples 
demonstrate the value of building environmental and social criteria into 
commercial activities in Africa.</P>
<P>The cost of not being socially and environmentally responsible is well known. 
When media reports uncovered child labour in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, 
it was threatened with the loss of a US$1 billion global market and was quick to 
collaborate with global brands, UN agencies, Government and civil society to 
find appropriate solutions. Similar concerns about threats to future business 
prompted Tanzanian tea, coffee and sisal enterprises to recognize the value of 
phasing out the use of child labour. Similarly the economic impact of not 
responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis in South Africa prompted Eskom, Anglo Coal, BP 
In the case of multinational oil giant BP, if the company paid for triple 
combination drug therapy for all employees in its Oil Africa Region thought to 
be currently infected, the total estimated drug bill would be US$16 million. and 
others to invest heavily in HIV/AIDS education and support. In 1995, Eskom 
projected overall direct HIV/AIDS treatment costs at 15% of the company's 
payroll by 2005 (e.g., ill-health retirements, insured benefit schemes and 
medical claims). As a result, actuaries recommended a fundamental review of 
Eskom's remuneration and benefit policy, and the company began to budget for and 
design appropriate HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment responses. These examples 
offer powerful evidence of the need for enterprises to embrace social and 
environmental concerns.</P>
<P>While the research findings noted above offer encouraging evidence of the 
link between enterprise performance and social and environmental action, "there 
remains a significant gap between what is intuitively logical and what one can 
prove" as a new report on the business case for corporate sustainability 
reveals. In Buried Treasure, SustainAbility and UNEP (2001) suggest that brand 
value and reputation has the strongest positive link to the sustainable 
development performance of enterprises. Consequently, they argue that business 
case analysis has to move beyond an exclusive focus on financial measures. The 
authors nevertheless note that business case research supports the positive 
links between verified financial results and sustainable development 
performance. The implication is that one can make the business case "without 
having to exclusively rely on indirect or intangible measures of business 
success." SustainAbility and UNEP (2001), p. 2. The message for African 
enterprises from this research is that support for initiatives such as the 
Global Compact can bring direct and tangible bottom line benefits. However, 
owners and managers also need to take non-financial indicators into account, 
such as reputation and community profile, when developing and implementing 
social and environmental policies. By strengthening their relations with local 
communities, African enterprises are more likely to earn a 'social license to 
operate' and achieve positive economic, social and environmental results.</P>
<H3>Towards a Global Compact Agenda for African Enterprises</H3>
<P>In this paper, we have argued that African enterprises and 
their social partners have important roles to play in the Global Compact process 
and in Africa's long-term development. The search for mutually beneficial human 
relationships lies at the heart of the Global Compact, as does Léopold Senghor's 
vision of enterprise activities that respect "the reality of [Africa's] soil, 
climate and people." Senghor (1976), p. 79. Ensuring that all enterprise 
activities in Africa link economic, social and ecological objectives is what the 
Global Compact process is essentially about.</P>
<P>The need for a Global Compact agenda for African enterprises is why we are 
all here at this conference. Throughout this paper, we have explored the role 
and relevance of the Global Compact for Africa. But what can the owners and 
managers of African enterprises do tomorrow, particularly those in the 
small-scale and microenterprise sector, to lend their support to the Global 
Compact principles? As this paper has demonstrated, various African enterprises 
have already started to make substantial progress with the implementation of 
social and environmental initiatives. Building upon this experience, the 
following suggestions are intended to offer African enterprises some initial 
ideas about how to work together for human rights, labour standards and 
sustainable development at the local level:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Strengthen relationships with employees, business 
  partners and other stakeholders being attentive to principles of fairness, 
  kindness and mutual respect.</LI><LI>Increase awareness and knowledge of relevant national 
  legal requirements and local bylaws, and ensure enterprise compliance.</LI><LI>Create partnerships with other relevant enterprises 
  in your community to explore local concerns about human rights, labour 
  standards and environmental sustainability.</LI><LI>Identify relevant local resources on human rights, 
  labour rights and environmental issues (e.g., NGOs, trade unions, business 
  service providers, local authorities, etc.).</LI><LI>Enter into dialogue with NGOs, trade unions, 
  community groups and other stakeholders to help identify local priorities for 
  enterprise action on human rights, labour rights and environmental issues.</LI><LI>Develop social and environmental action plans for 
  specific local enterprise groups or sectors (e.g, primary producers; market 
  traders; retailers; manufacturers; service industries; etc.)</LI><LI>Promote local awareness and learning about the 
  benefits for enterprises, workers and communities of adopting social and 
  environmental initiatives.</LI><LI>Work in partnership with government, civil society and international 
  organizations to gain a better understanding of the long-term human 
  development needs of your local community.</LI></UL>
<P>During the course of our discussions at this conference, we need to work 
together towards the development of a Global Compact action agenda for African 
enterprises. We should also undertake to continue our dialogue at the national 
and local levels throughout Africa and elsewhere about the value of the Global 
Compact for African enterprises and communities.</P>
<P>At the beginning of this paper, we took inspiration from the words of the 
former Senegalese President Léopold Senghor about the importance of human 
relationships in the African context. In closing, let us look to the future 
through the eyes of the current President of Senegal Abdoulaye Wade:</P>
<P>Education is about making men and women citizens of their times. We need to 
prepare men and women who can live in this century. No African child must feel 
like an outsider in this global village. Opening Speech to the World Education 
Forum in Dakar, Senegal, 26 April 2000.</P>
<P>Therein lies the key to the success of the Global Compact in Africa. As an 
educational tool, the Global Compact seeks to engage business, civil society, 
governments and the United Nations in an international partnership for a better 
world. As dynamic members of this global village, African enterprises and their 
social partners have a vital role to play in this learning process.</P>
