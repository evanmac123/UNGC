          <H1>Creating the Tipping Point towards Corporate Responsibility: Reflections on 
Meeting Expectations in the Global Economy</H1>
<H2>University of Notre Dame April 21-23, 2002</H2>
<P>Sandra Waddock<BR>Boston College<BR>Carroll School of

<P><EM>There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world; and 
that is an idea whose time has come.</EM><BR>Victor Hugo</P>
<P>Has the time for a Global Compact that integrates business and social 
interests, is based on principles accepted by countries around the world, and 
asks companies to think beyond the bottom line in terms of their operating 
practices, actually come? In 1999, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called upon 
global business leaders to create a 'global compact' in which companies agreed 
to live up to nine fundamental principles that, if fully implemented, would 
shape the world economy. Many people were and still are skeptical that business 
could or would live up to those commitments. Annan's words presented a 
significant challenge to world business leaders:</P>
<P>…<EM>I want to challenge you to join me in taking our relationship to a still 
higher level. I propose to that you [corporate leaders] …and we, the United 
Nations, initiate a global compact of shared values and principles, which will 
give a human face to the global market.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Globalization is a fact of life. But I believe we have underestimated its 
fragility. The problem is this. The spread of markets outpaces the ability of 
societies and their political systems to adjust to them, let alone to guide the 
course they take. History teaches us that such an imbalance between the 
economic, social and political realms can never be sustained for very long</EM>. 
…</P>
<P><EM>We have to choose between a global market driven only by calculations of 
short-term profit, and one which has a human face. Between a world which 
condemns a quarter of the human race to starvation and squalor, and one which 
offers everyone at least a chance of prosperity, in a healthy environment. 
Between a selfish free-for-all in which we ignore the fate of the losers, and a 
culture in which the strong and successful accept their responsibilities, 
showing global vision and leadership.<BR></EM>Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, 
United Nations,<BR>challenging the 1999 World Economic Forum of<BR>business 
leaders to form The Global Compact Kofi Annan, Business and the U.N.: A Global 
Compact of Shared Values and Principles, January 31, 1999, World Economic Forum, 
Davos, Switzerland. Reprinted in Vital Speeches of the Day, February 15, 1999, 
65 (9): 260-261.</P>
<P>By the time the first US-based conference on the Global Compact was held in 
April 2002 at the University of Notre Dame, hundreds of companies globally had 
submitted letters of commitment to upholding the nine principles of the Global 
Compact. But the Global Compact had not yet reached a 'tipping point' Malcolm 
Gladwell. <EM>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big 
Difference</EM>. Boston: Little Brown &amp; Company, 2000. where the nine 
fundamental principles articulated in it were considered essential to doing 
global business. Few of the 'signatory' companies were US companies, despite the 
apparent need for leadership by US companies to make the GC effective in the 
long run.</P>
<P>One of the unspoken questions underlying the Global Compact conference, thus, 
was the fundamental question: what will it take to create this tipping point for 
corporate responsibility especially among US firms? That is, what will it take 
to make managing corporate responsibility into what colleagues and I have 
elsewhere termed the 'new business imperative?' Sandra Waddock, Charles Bodwell, 
and Samuel B. Graves, Responsibility: The New Business Imperative, <EM>Academy 
of Management Executive</EM>, in press (May 2002). The issues raised at the 
conference by various participates suggest some of the transitions, corporate 
activities, and practices that are needed to create this tipping point. Below I 
will synthesize my impressions, from the meeting, of what these issues and 
practices are.</P>
<P>Many observers have argued that companies need to manage their 
responsibilities to stakeholders, to societies in which they operate, and to the 
natural environment, in much the same way that they manage quality, 
product/market development, and customer relationships. E.g., Sandra Waddock, 
<EM>Leading Corporate Citizens: Vision, Values, Value Added. New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 2002; James E. Post, Lee E. Preston, and Sybil Sachs. Redefining 
the Corporation</EM>. New York: Oxford, 2002. Of course, the seminal book on 
managing stakeholder relationships is R. Edward Freeman, Management: A 
Stakeholder Approach . Boston: Pitman, 1984. Using a framework for managing 
corporate responsibility developed in collaboration with Charles Bodwell of the 
International Labor Organization, the key issues facing companies that arose 
during the Global Compact Conference are developed below. The framework for 
managing responsibility used in this paper was jointly developed by me and my 
collaborator from the International Labor Organization, Charles Bodwell. See 
Sandra Waddock and Charles Bodwell, From TQM to TRM: Emerging Responsibility 
Management Approaches, <EM>Journal of Corporate Citizenship</EM>, in press 
(summer 2002). This framework, called TRM for total responsibility management, 
provides an outline of managing corporate responsibility that (as with quality 
management) can be applied within units, divisions, or even functions as well as 
across entire enterprises.</P>
<P>Analogous in many ways to managing quality, responsibility management 
involves three major processes: 1) <EM>inspiration</EM> , which combines 
creating a vision for the company's responsibilities that generates leadership 
commitment, identifying foundational values to which the company adheres, and 
stakeholder engagement; 2) <EM>integration</EM> the responsibility vision and 
values into the company's strategies, human resource practices, and management 
systems; and 3) developing <EM>innovation</EM> and <EM>improvement</EM> systems 
that remediate where necessary and create a learning environment for the 
enterprise, all based on a set of indicators that help the company measure 
progress toward its responsibility goals.</P>
<P>The Global Compact has the credibility and clout of the United Nations behind 
it. Its nine principles have been agreed upon by nations throughout the world. 
It is simple to understand and aspirational in its intent. As participants in 
the meeting suggested, its very simplicity works in its favor with respect to 
companies' willingness to sign on, even while its voluntary nature creates 
concern among actors in other sectors of society.</P>
<H3>Inspiration</H3>
<P>Creating a vision around not only the company's strategic mission and 
vision, but also its responsibilities as they relate to the principles of the 
Global Compact is a necessary first step for companies engaging in the GC.</P>
<P>Leadership Commitment. The 'inspiration' process of managing corporate 
responsibility involves getting top leadership (and others) committed to a 
responsibility vision. In the case of the Global Compact, this involves 
assessing the company's commitment to and leadership on the GC's nine 
principles. Several companies considering signing on or having already done so 
have created steering committees to investigate how the GC could become a 
sustainable element of corporate strategy and practices, while simultaneously 
providing guidance and oversight at the board of directors level. Top management 
commitment to the GC's principles is clearly essential for driving understanding 
about the importance of implementing the principles down into the 
organization.</P>
<P>Foundational Values. The very act of signing the Global Compact creates a 
sense of legitimacy for the foundational values, or what some call 'hypernorms,' 
Thomas Donaldson and Thomas W. Dunfee, <EM>Ties that Bind: A Social Contracts 
Approach to Business Ethics</EM>. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1999. 
embedded in the principles. Foundational values are those that are generally 
accepted throughout the world, as the GC's principles have been by the countries 
signatory to the declarations and conventions from which the principles are 
drawn. Foundational values create a baseline or floor below for standards, going 
below which can create ethical and reputational problems for the company. In 
recent years, there has been a proliferation of codes and standards and the GC 
has the benefit of codifying the most important values in a relatively simple 
framework.</P>
<P>Many companies have articulated their own core values, which provide guidance 
on decision making, strategies, and every-day practices. Several presentations 
highlighted the critical importance of the company's core values as they 
developed their responses to the GC. Particularly for companies in service or 
knowledge-based industries, integrity, trust, and cultural diversity play 
important roles in the company's success, for as a participant stated, 'people 
are our business. For this company, participation in the GC was the 'right thing 
to do.' It also, however, provided additional motivation to improve the 
company's performance because paying attention to anti-discrimination policies 
enabled it to build a more diverse client base served by a more diverse employee 
base, enhancing long-term profitability. ' Another company articulated that 
trust, respect, and fairness are our fundamental values, answering the question 
'what do we stand for?' For this company, responsibility is 'not optional. You 
must be it' and find the sources of competitive advantage that arise from being 
responsible.</P>
<P>The GC's principles themselves can result in important dilemmas. For example, 
pharmaceutical companies struggle with the issue of providing access to medicine 
combined with the need for funding future research and current profitability. 
Other companies struggle with issues of living wage, diversity and harassment, 
noncomplicity with human rights abuses, and the precautionary approach (not 
principle) to environmental sustainability because of the commitments implied 
and their business implications. Further, some companies operate in countries 
where labor standards, such as freedom of association, are not permitted. If 
companies are to take the GC seriously—to mean it, as one participant said—these 
issues need to be resolved in ways that make continuing to do business 
feasible.</P>
<P>Stakeholder Engagement. Stakeholder engagement involves figuring out ways for 
the company to interact with key internal and external stakeholders. The 
engagement process allows companies obtain their opinions and inputs into 
corporate activities, and work collaboratively with them to ensure that mutual 
needs and interests are addressed, without the company's having to give up its 
own responsibility for strategic initiatives and business development. As one 
participant noted, this issue comes up particularly with respect to the long 
supply chains that companies today have evolved and creates a need for building 
awareness that external stakeholders may not differentiate between the company's 
and its suppliers' practices, especially with respect to the GC's principles. 
Initial reactions by executives may be that supplier practices are 'none of my 
business,' that avoiding cultural imperialism might dictate staying out of the 
suppliers' businesses, or that a pluralism of values globally exists that cannot 
be dealt with. By working with NGOs (and other stakeholders) that are willing to 
engage, some companies have found, however, that reasonable solutions to obvious 
dilemmas with no clear or straightforward solution can sometimes be found.</P>
<H3>Integration</H3>
<P>Involvement in the Global Compact means taking seriously the need to 
operationalize the principles into strategies and everyday practice, not just 
rhetorically articulate them. The key is to ensure that the principles go beyond 
rhetoric into practices that are known both from the top down and the bottom 
up.</P>
<P>Integration into Corporate Strategies and Vision. Making the GC principles 
real is a key concern of companies as they consider whether to sign on or not. 
As one corporate representative stated, it is necessary to make the principles 
'part and parcel' of the company's purpose, as an 'owned' affair, rather than an 
add-on to existing activities.</P>
<P>Integration into Human Resource Practices and Systems. Among the key issues 
in the Global Compact are human and employee rights. Because employees are the 
stakeholders who actually carry out the company's strategies, they are 
critically important stakeholders. Principles such as the anti-discrimination 
principles (#6) make clear, as a conference presenter stated, that 'ethics count 
and are inseparable from doing business.' And as another presented noted, the 
reality is responsibility to employees and other stakeholders is important 
because 'core business practices have greater impact in the long run' than 
practices outside core business (e.g., charitable contributions).</P>
<P>Interestingly, as companies become involved in the GC principles, they 
sometimes find, as one participating company did, that the problems they had 
originally thought would be found in their supply chains are sometimes internal. 
In this situation, the issue was that of paying a living wage and the company 
found that it was not so much suppliers' employees that had the problem as the 
company's own custodial staff.</P>
<P>Integration of the Principles into Management Systems. The GC's principles 
lay out a set of standards and draw attention to issues, such as human rights, 
living wage, and freedom of association, that are not entirely familiar to 
management. Focusing on implementing the principles causes the company to pay 
attention to such issues.</P>
<P>Participants in the conference made clear that signing the GC principles is 
only the first step in a multi-pronged process of implementation. Not only is 
awareness building with respect to the principles needed internally, but also 
companies need to find ways to integrate the principles into management systems. 
Still, there is considerable uncertainty among participating companies about how 
to actually apply the principles in practice, particularly with respect to 
specific functional areas like research and development, marketing, and 
manufacturing. What was clear from the discussion was the complexity of the 
integration process, simply because of many companies size, geographic spread, 
structure, and product/market mix.</P>
<H3>Innovation and Improvement</H3>
<P>No company will ever be perfect. While the Global Compact establishes 
what amount to aspirational principles, it is, as a participant pointed out, 
inevitably likely that there will be a gap between the ideal and the reality of 
day-to-day practice. This gap creates the need for on-going efforts at 
improvement and learning, that is, for the establishment of a long-term process 
by which the company copes with problems and issues as they arise.</P>
<P>Indicators: Measuring and Assessing Progress on the Principles. Critical to 
the implementation of the voluntary Global Compact is the issue of measurement 
and monitoring progress toward achievement and implementation of the principles 
in practice. Issues raised around the credibility that companies have when they 
sign onto the GC hinge on the reliability and validity of implementation of 
responsibility goals toward the principles, especially in the eyes of employees 
and external stakeholders that include non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
customers. As one participant pointed out, as companies become more explicit 
about their own core values and raise expectations about living up to the 
foundational values inherent in the GC, they can create vulnerabilities for 
themselves that might not previously have been in public awareness. For example, 
many managers today are unaware of issues surrounding human rights or certain 
labor standards, especially deep within their supply chains. Adherence to GC 
principles raises up such concerns to top management, as well as NGO, attention 
and creates the potential need for external monitoring and verification of 
adherence to stated goals.</P>
<P>One issue that comes up for companies as they consider the GC is how to 
measure cost avoidance. Adherence to some of the principles can mean that 
certain problems are not experienced, e.g., NGO or consumer protests against 
labor practices, productivity problems that do not develop because employees are 
well treated, or environmental clean-up costs that need not be incurred. But, as 
a participant stated, 'cost avoidance is hard to measure.' Dealing with this 
issue effectively, very likely means rethinking corporate measurement systems 
and creating new standards for transparency and external accountability, as 
discussed in the next section.</P>
<P>Transparency and Accountability for Results. One of the implications of 
signing onto the Global Compact's principles may be that companies need to 
create considerably more transparent—and correspondingly credible—external 
reporting systems than many have today. With clearly stated principles and 
interaction with key stakeholders who hold the company up to the stated 
standards, comes anew level of accountability. Although may companies have 
recognized that NGOs and other activists are already holding them 
accountable—and publicizing transgressions widely—the visibility of signing onto 
the GC creates more impetus than ever for transparency. It is also the case that 
NGOs are not democratically elected and may represent a diffuse set of 
interests, thus creating a system that works will take time, engagement to build 
trusting relationships, and very likely a long-term process orientation.</P>
<P>Reporting standards for the triple bottom line of economic, social, and 
environment goals are just beginning to emerge. The major contender is the GRI, 
the Global Reporting Initiative. See: <A 
href="http://www.globalreporting.org">www.globalreporting.org</A>. The GRI is 
attempting to create standards similar to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) for social and environmental reporting that are applicable on 
a global basis. As such reporting standards become better established, according 
to some participants in the conference, it is likely that NGOs will have more 
credibility in verification and monitoring than will the major accounting firms. 
It seems clear that some form of independent monitoring and verification system 
will be needed to satisfy corporate critics that companies are actually living 
up to their pledges.</P>
<H3>Issues</H3>
<P>Numerous issues associated with signing on to the GC—or not—were raised 
by participants. What follows is a brief explication of some of the issues 
raised during the conference.</P>
<P>Sustainability: One of the important things to come out of the discussion on 
the Global Compact at the conference was a shared understanding of the need to 
create a sustainable approach to managing and implementing the principles 
embedded in the Global Compact, thus sustainability is a key issue. The 
definition of sustainability that appeared to underlie the presentations and 
conversation at the meeting, however, is broader than the more typical usage in 
its environmental context. Companies themselves need to be sustainable and to 
engender sustainable relationships with key stakeholders, as well are 
recognizing the need to create more ecologically sustainable approaches to the 
use of environmental resources. This broad concept of sustainability was 
captured in the phrase used by one of the corporate participants recognizing 
that the company needed a 'societal license to operate' in order to be 
successful long term.</P>
<P>Credibility and Trust: Additionally, it was clear that companies considering 
signing were taking both the letter of commitment to the UN Secretary General 
that signals their willingness to participate in the Global Compact and the need 
to live up to the principles articulated very seriously. In part it seems that 
the credibility arises because of the UN's involvement in the initiative, 
putting the weight of international agreements behind the principles. In part, 
the seriousness comes because of the requirement for a letter signed by the CEO 
of the company, which puts the full weight of the company's own reputation 
behind the letter. In part, the seriousness rests on the reality that any 
signatory company's own credibility is at stake. Its stakeholders need to trust 
the company to stick to its work—and to adhere to the standards of integrity 
implied by the company's own core values, as well as the foundational values 
embedded in the GC. Stakeholder engagement or social dialogue is a needed part 
of the process for establishing trust and credibility among entities and 
individuals with differing perspectives.</P>
<P>Contract: Some companies raised concerns about what the signing the 
principles amounted to a contract , rather than a set of aspirations and goals. 
One of the risks perceived by companies, participants indicated, is that the GC 
principles will be interpreted literally or legalistically, especially by 
external critics of companies.</P>
<P>Visibility and Vulnerability. Signing on to the Global Compact creates 
leadership opportunities for companies, and generates a degree of external 
recognition. With this awareness of the company's stated commitment to uphold 
the GC's principles comes also a bit of vulnerability if the company does not 
live up to the standards. Issues of responsibility, accountability, and 
transparency are real when signing the GC, hence companies need to be aware of 
this source of potential vulnerability. Combined with the relatively lack of 
credibility of companies and the great degree of credibility of NGOs, some 
companies realize that getting 'out in front' on these issues creates not only 
leadership but also vulnerability. Recognition of this vulnerability may be why 
companies represented at the conference appear to be taking signing the letter 
to Kofi Annan as seriously as they are. At the same time, one participant noted 
that the GC's principles give NGOs a tool to go to non-signatory companies and 
ask 'what about you?'</P>
<P>Engagement with NGOs. NGO opinions on corporate responsibility are likely to 
carry more credibility than corporate opinions. Still, one of the points 
stressed at the meeting was that there are differences among non-governmental 
organizations that companies need to weigh when considering their engagement 
policies. Some NGOs are ideological and likely to be unwilling to engage in 
constructive conversations with companies, while less ideological NGOs may well 
be able to engage in fruitful collaboration. If constructive stakeholder 
engagement—or social dialogue—is in place, companies can learn from mistakes and 
problems, which will inevitably happen, rather than simply taking the heat from 
them.</P>
<P>Trade-off or Win/Win: The GC provides a framework for companies to move 
forward on meeting global standards, but many corporate leaders still believe 
that there is necessarily a 'trade-off' between being responsible and being 
profitable. Although considerable empirical evidence exist within both the

socially responsible in investing? The Journal of Investing . Summer, 6 (2): 
11-18. See also Angel, J. J., and Rivoli, P. 1997. Does ethical investing impose 
a cost upon the firm? A theoretical examination? Journal of Investing, Winter, 6 
(4): 57-61; and Sandra Waddock, Samuel B. Graves, and Renee Gorski. "Performance

responsible investing. Applied Financial Economics ), April 1995, 5 (2): 69-78;

the Academy of Management Annual meeting, Washington, DC, 2001. literatures to 
suggest that the more likely reality is that creating win/win scenarios, the 
'trade-off' mentality still needs to be dealt with. Cases and examples, 
highlighted in the GC's website can provide further evidence that helps deal 
with this perception over time.</P>
<P>Transparency: The Missing Tenth Principle: One point noted at the conference 
was that there is a 'tenth principle,' an anti-corruption and transparency 
principle that is still missing. This principle was omitted because there was at 
the time of the GC's creation no universally accepted declaration against 
corruption, however, the UN realizes the need for such a principle. When the 
declaration or convention is accepted, it will be included in the Global 
Compact.</P>
<P><BR>Toward the Tipping Point?<BR>It was clear from both the participants in 
the conference and the conversation that the Global Compact had not yet reached 
a 'tipping point' in the United States at the time of this conference. Yet it 
was equally obvious that there is considerable corporate interest in the Global 
Compact and the principles that it stands for, particularly as the fundamental 
question with which the GC deals continues to be raised. That question, as 
articulated at the conference, is 'What is the appropriate distribution of 
responsibilities in society?' Businesses, governments, and civil society 
organizations, representing different points of view, are all involved in this 
determination, and in making responsible corporate practice, as articulated by 
the GC's principles, an integral part of doing business not just in the good 
times but in every time period.</P>
<P>It was also clear that signing on to the Global Compact is merely the first 
step in what amounts to an unending process of continual learning and 
improvement. Summarizing one participant's remarks, this is not a program. It's 
a process. It has a beginning, but no end. It can help people make good 
decisions, share learning across businesses and regions, build trust and 
commitment through team-based action learning, and empower locals to take 
ownership and accountability for their decisions. As an organization, the Global 
Compact is young and still learning and evolving.</P>
<P>More conversations like the one at this conference are probably needed as the 
tipping point is approached. Thinking back to the analogy to quality management, 
made at the outset of this short paper, we might take a lesson from that 
'movement.' What 'tipped' quality into becoming the business imperative that it 
is today? Arguably, it was pressures from a combination of sources that created 
the tipping point. For example, competitive pressures (e.g., Japanese 
competition), social pressures (e.g., consumers demanding better quality), 
education and information (e.g., the NBC White paper of the late 1970s "If Japan 
Can, Why Can't We?"), and companies requiring suppliers to adhere to quality 
standards (e.g., ISO's quality standards) created momentum for quality.</P>
<P>A similar set of pressures exists today that are driving corporate 
responsibility to potentially become a business imperative in the future. See 
Waddock, Bodwell, and Graves, 2002, in press. Imagine a world in which major 
corporations that had signed onto the Global Compact required their suppliers to 
also do so. Imagine that companies doing so developed systems of stakeholder 
engagement for which they were willing to be held accountable, as the AA 1000 
framework advocates, See: <A href="http://www.accountability.org.uk" 
target=_blank>www.accountability.org.uk</A>. and required their suppliers to do 
so as well.</P>
<P>Imagine that they similarly adhered to the labor standards of the GC with 
measurement and internal accountability systems resembling those developed by 
Social Accountability International in its SA 8000 standards See: <A 
href="http://www.cepaa.org." target=_blank>http://www.cepaa.org.</A>.--and 
required suppliers to do so as well. And imagine further that external 
verification and monitoring could be assured through accountability and 
transparency standards reporting mechanisms like those under development by the 
Global Reporting Initiative. See: <A href="http://www.globalreporting.org" 
target=_blank>www.globalreporting.org</A>. Such a scenario, of course, requires 
the leadership of major firms, their willingness to hold themselves 
accountable—and be accountable to their stakeholders for the major impacts of 
doing business. A hard road, perhaps, but possibly a better road to go down 
voluntarily than be forced down it by activists', customers', and social 
investors' demands for transparency.</P>
