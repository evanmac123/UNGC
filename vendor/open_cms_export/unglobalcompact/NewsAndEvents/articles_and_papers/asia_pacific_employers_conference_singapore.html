          <H1>Asia Pacific Employers Conference Endorses the Global Compact</H1>
<H2>5th Asia-Pacific High-Level Employers Conference</H2>
<H2>Singapore, 9-10 October 2000</H2>
<P>NOTE: See sections 8, 9, and 10 in this newly released report 
for an endorsement of the U.N. Global Compact, as well as sections 7 and 11 for 
International Labor Organization references. Section 10 discusses the idea<BR>of 
country-level meetings and national Global Compact committees.</P>
<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

<P></P>
<H3>The Presidents and Chief Executive Officers of 19 national employers' 
organisations from the Asia-Pacific region, having met in Singapore on 9 and 10 
October 2000 for their fifth conference, conclude as follows:</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>The financial crisis in the region has proven to be 
  relatively short-lived, and most affected countries have emerged from it with 
  differing degrees of success. Though traumatic to go through, the crisis has 
  resulted in encouraging greater transparency, competitiveness and 
  liberalisation. It has forced enterprises to restructure and re-focus, and 
  many are thus in a better position to deal with the new economic environment 
  driven by globalisation and rapid technological change. The situation varies 
  across the region, but on the whole Asian and Pacific countries have achieved 
  better growth than the global average.</LI><LI>The emerging global economy provides opportunities to improve standards of 
  living and reduce poverty and unemployment, but it also presents several 
  challenges. It calls for greater investment in human capital and increased 
  partnership by employers and their organisations with governments, employees 
  and trade unions. It also calls for enhanced efforts to promote the policy 
  environment which is necessary for greater prosperity everywhere.</LI></OL>
<H3>Human resources development for competitiveness: issues for the Asia-Pacific 
region, and the role of employers' organisations</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>In the emerging global marketplace human capital will 
  matter more to enterprises than physical capital, and human capabilities will 
  determine the value of enterprises. With the rise of the knowledge economy 
  there is a global war for talent. Some developing countries in the region have 
  demonstrated an ability to develop their talent in information technology, and 
  this is promising. However, this represents only a small part of their formal 
  sectors, and the informal sector remains a major source of concern. Human 
  resource development strategies should target everybody, in order that all 
  might contribute to general prosperity and share in it.</LI><LI>Manufacturing remained an area where Asia is very 
  strong, and should continue to be given high priority. However, there is a 
  need to move from competitiveness based on cost-reduction to one based on 
  value to the customer. Competitiveness should be based on a human resources 
  strategy that equips people with capabilities that provide them with a range 
  of choices. Human resources development at the enterprise level should lead to 
  value added to the employee as well as to the enterprise. People and 
  enterprises should then take the responsibility for the choices they make.</LI><LI>&nbsp;HRD has the purpose to improve the capability of 
  people to adapt to the world of work in a comprehensive manner, and thus 
  should be promoted with the emphasis on employability. Today, information 
  technology is a great tool for business development, especially in the 
  manufacturing sector that is a priority area for most of the countries in the 
  region. In this sense, training to catch up with the evolving information 
  technology should be given an appropriate place within the whole scheme of 
HRD.</LI><LI>Human resources development is thus an important 
  responsibility for employers. However, significant areas of it are primarily 
  the responsibility of governments, and should remain so, especially with 
  regard to the infrastructure necessary. There is also a role for others. 
  Dialogue between employer organisations and educational institutions is 
  essential to ensure curricula are relevent to emerging market needs. 
  Partnerships between government, employers' and workers' organisations unions 
  have proved to be crucial in promoting and implementing human resources 
  development strategies. Equally important is the role of individual workers. 
  It is important to demarcate the respective roles of each stakeholder. 
  Employers have a particular role in changing organisational culture, promoting 
  individual responsibility and attitudes.</LI><LI>The employers of the Asia-Pacific region endorse the conclusions of the 
  88th Session of the International Labour Conference on human resources 
  training and development, which reflected a good example of tripartite 
  understanding on a matter of crucial importance. They recall in particular the 
  proposal to revise the ILO Human Resources Development Recommendation, 1975 
  (No. 150), and hope it would be given a greater urgency than other matters 
  currently being given consideration in the context of ILO 
  standard-setting.</LI></OL>
<H3>Responsible business: the Global Compact</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>The reduction of trade barriers and the spread of the market economy have 
  opened opportunities to people everywhere, but there have also been problems 
  that have generated a backlash against globalisation in developed and 
  developing countries. There is presently a gap between the market and society, 
  which needs to be closed. The alienation of groups from technology<BR>and the absence of the skills and knowledge 
  required to connect with the global economy have resulted in widening income 
  gaps between people and between countries. Perceptions of unfairness in the 
  setting of global rules and in the outcomes of trade regimes have also 
  fostered animosity towards the way liberalisation of trade has developed. 
  Globalisation remains fragile, and if it is stopped or reversed the prospects 
  for growth and development everywhere will be considerably diminished. 
  Although a major part of the measures that should be taken are the 
  responsibility of governments, employers have an important role in developing 
  a market economy with a human face in response to some of the problems 
  associated with globalisation.</LI><LI>The Global Compact initiated by the Secretary-General of the United 
  Nations is a welcome initiative in this respect. It identifies universally 
  shared values in the areas of human rights, labour and the environment which 
  business is in a position to promote. It is an open plan, which provides a 
  framework for enterprises to voluntarily take action to contribute to 
  objectives of the world community through private initiatives. The Global 
  Compact does not envisage a monitoring mechanism or any other means 
  of<BR>compulsion.</LI><LI>The Asian and Pacific employers organisations endorse 
  the Global Compact and encourage their members to participate in pursuing its 
  goals. In doing so they support the position of the International Organisation 
  of Employersand encourage it to take further steps to promote the initiative 
  internationally. There was also the need to promote the Global Compact within 
  the national level through an action plan involving organising programmes at 
  the country level on the Global Compact and creating awareness by getting the 
  media involved in publicising the Global Compact. Employers' organisations 
  should take initiatives in this respect, and the multilateral system should 
  provide support where appropriate. It may be useful to develop a common agenda 
  for country-level meetings, to form national committees and make awards to 
  recognise and encourage companies that take initiatives and post their 
  experiences on the internet site of the Global Compact. Employers should take 
  action to give substance to the Global Compact, and not leave it to others to 
  do so in their place. In order to be effective, the values of the Global 
  Compact need to be reflected at the work place.</LI><LI>The Asian and Pacific employers organisations also endorse the position of 
  the International Organisation of Employers on international labour standards, 
  and underline the urgency of reforming the standards policy of the 
  International Labour Organisation.</LI></OL>
<H3>New Dimensions in Forging Stronger Partnerships with Government and 
Unions</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>Relationships between the government and the social 
  partners can play a critical role in the competitiveness of enterprises and 
  economies. Where the relationship is based on mutual trust and understanding, 
  it is possible to build partnerships and cooperation that take account of the 
  needs of each party and produce outcomes beneficial to all. It can foster 
  industrial harmony and help to create an environment in which responsible 
  unionism and enlightened management can work together to generate and share 
  prosperity in a mutually satisfactory way. It facilitates the introduction of 
  measures that permit the flexibility and change necessary in the new economy, 
  in particular with respect to new employment relationships and training needs. 
  The Asia-Pacific region has examples of how tripartism and social dialogue 
  effectively works in this manner.</LI><LI>Social dialogue should lead to shared values and 
  goals, and the partners to it should engage in it in good faith. However, the 
  search for compromise and accommodation should not result in the undermining 
  of basic policy positions or interests.</LI><LI>The critical relationship is between workers and 
  employers at the work place, and bipartism should help to foster that. Both 
  bipartism and tripartism are important as each contributes in different 
  spheres to the overall goals of enterprise and national competitiveness.</LI><LI>However, tripartism and bipartism do not function 
  effectively in many countries in the region. The lack of representative and 
  responsible unions has in some countries compromised the relevance of the 
  dialogue. In other countries the multiplicity of trade unions and rivalries 
  between them have rendered the dialogue difficult and unproductive. The lack 
  of sufficient trust and understanding between unions and employers has 
  prevented social dialogue from delivering on its promise. The lack of a 
  sufficient enabling environment is often an obstacle to successful tripartism 
  and bipartism.</LI><LI>In several countries in the region, government needs to create the 
  regulatory and policy environment that would lead to improving the partnership 
  between employers and workers. The measures to be taken might include the 
  creation of institutions for dialogue, social safety nets and flexibility in 
  labour legislation. Employers and workers also need to make the effort to 
  build the mutual trust and understanding necessary for their partnership to 
  work</LI></OL>
<H3>Strengthening Cooperation Amongst Employers Organisations in the Region</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>It was agreed that employers organisations in the 
  region should have their own form of cooperation appropriate to them to meet 
  the challenges and requirements of the region. Such cooperation should be 
  within a framework and should be continuous and sustainable.</LI><LI>The High/Level Conference is held every three years 
  and the participants felt the need for continuous interaction. It was 
  suggested that there should be a loose confederation of employer organisations 
  in the region to accommodate this need under the umbrella of the parent 
  organisation, which is the IOE. It was agreed to have a working group to study 
  this suggestion and provide a paper on such an arrangement by June 2001. Mr 
  Toshio Suzuki was appointed the convenor of this working group and will work 
  out the modalities of communications and meetings amongst the members of the 
  group.The other members of the group are Mr I.P Anand, Mr Cho Nam-hong, Mr 
  C.K. Hyder, Mr Ancheta Tan and Mr S.R. de Silva.</LI><LI>Nikkeiren offered to extend coordination services to obtain information 
  and data needed for the work. They will also use sub-regional group meetings 
  before June 2001, as well as direct communication, as opportunities for the 
  working group to gather information and furnish its report. </LI></OL>
