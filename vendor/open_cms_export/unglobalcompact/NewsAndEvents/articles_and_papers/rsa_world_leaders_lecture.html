          <H1>RSA World Leaders Lecture</H1>
<H2>"Beyond Good Intentions: Corporate Citizenship for a New 
Century"</H2>
<H2>Mary Robinson, United Nations High Comissioner for Human 
Rights<BR>London, 7 May 2002</H2>
<P>Ladies and Gentlemen, <BR>It is a pleasure to be here today 
with all of you, members and guests of the Royal Society for the encouragement 
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. I have long admired the range and scope of 
your activities. You will understand, however, that it is somewhat daunting to 
be invited to deliver the inaugural RSA World Leaders Lecture.</P>
<P>May I be bold enough to recall what I said when I was honoured to receive the 
Albert Medal from your President, His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, at 
an enjoyable ceremony at Buckingham Palace last November. I took some pleasure 
in noting the fact that the Royal Society, founded in 1754, drew inspiration 
from the Royal Dublin Society, founded in 1731.</P>
<P>Apart from that story underscoring the intimate relationship between the two 
countries, it also reminds us of the great strength of a common tradition in the 
two islands, the space that existed for voluntary organisations outside of 
government to act for the public interest – to foresee a role for what is now 
called civil society – or a vibrant "third sector."</P>
<P>The question must be asked now on a global level. How can the RSA's mission, 
- to create a civilised society based on a sustainable economy by stimulating 
debate, developing new ideas and encouraging cooperation between the creative 
sources of British society, - be harnessed to address the challenges of 
globalisation?</P>
<P>As Secretary-General Kofi Annan put it in his report to the UN Millennium 
Assembly, We the Peoples:</P>
<P>"we must think afresh about how we manage our joint activities and our shared 
interests, for many challenges that we confront today are beyond the reach of 
any state to meet on its own…We must form coalitions for change, often with 
partners well beyond the precincts of officialdom. No shift in the way we think 
or act can be more critical than this: we must put people at the center of 
everything we do."</P>
<P>The evidence that new approaches are urgently needed to solve persistent 
global problems is all around us, but all too easily overlooked. Consider the 
findings of a new report issued ahead of the special session on children which 
begins tomorrow at UN headquarters in New York. I know some of you will be 
intimately aware of the grim statistics, but they bear repeating:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Of the 132 million children born every year, 10.2 
  million - or one in 12 – will die from preventable diseases: measles, malaria, 
  diarrhea and prenatal conditions. 
  </LI><LI>150 million children from all regions of the world 
  are malnourished. Over 120 million will never go to school - the majority of 
  them girls. 
  </LI><LI>One of every five children between the ages of 5 and 14 in the developing 
  world will work, and half of those will do so full time.</LI></UL>
<P>Clearly, despite the growth of the global economy, and the world's 
commitment to a "first call for children", the reality is bleak. Why have we 
fallen short? At the heart of the problem is a lack of political will, a lack of 
accountability for failing to live up to international commitments, and in some 
countries, a severe lack of resources needed to make change. But I would propose 
that such shortcomings have also been due to a lack of imagination, an 
unwillingness to look for new solutions, and for new partners, to solve the 
problems of a new century.</P>
<P>Our efforts within the UN to confront the gaps in effective governance have 
increasingly sought to encourage the private sector and civil society in the 
kind of creativity, innovation and focus on good practice that has been the 
RSA's approach across the fields of business, design, the environment, education 
and the arts throughout its long history.</P>
<P>So I welcome this opportunity to share some thoughts on these issues and 
discuss with you the promise and the challenges of multi-stakeholder 
partnerships.</P>
<P>I should first explain briefly where human rights and my Office fit into the 
picture. The international human rights cause was adopted into the United 
Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights over a 
half-century ago.<BR>Since that time a rich and extensive body of international 
law directed at bettering the human condition has been agreed upon by states, 
including the numerous developing countries who were to achieve their 
independence with the support of the United Nations. A large part of that law 
concerns human rights machinery and institutions to implement the human rights 
norms and standards which have been created or evolved at national, regional and 
international levels.</P>
<P>The Office that I head as High Commissioner for Human Rights, is a recent 
example of these institutional developments. Established by the General Assembly 
eight years ago, the OHCHR is intended to offer leadership, support and 
co-ordination to the international human rights system. It is no small task. Our 
mandate is to promote and protect all human rights, civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural, of all people, in all countries. Predictably, the regular 
UN budget allocation (less than 2 per cent of the UN overall budget) is not 
commensurate with this ambition! We could not fulfil the ever expanding demands 
on the OHCHR without the voluntary contributions made by states, large and 
small, to our annual expenditure, a figure of some 75 million US dollars. The 
United Kingdom, I am glad to state here, is a major contributor.</P>
<P>If I were to encapsulate in a simple word the goal of my Office, and indeed 
of the entire international system of human rights, it would be in the word 
prevention. If human rights are respected, if basic education, housing and 
health care are secure, if there is freedom from personal violence and freedom 
for men and women to earn their living and raise their families, not only are 
human rights violations prevented, but conflict, terrorism and war can also be 
prevented.</P>
<H3>Beyond Good Intentions</H3>
<P>The title I have chosen for my lecture today is "Beyond Good Intentions: 
Corporate Citizenship for a New Century". I chose this title for two 
reasons:</P>
<P>First, to repeat a point which I made at the Albert Medal ceremony last year: 
business leaders don't have to wait – indeed, increasingly they can't afford to 
wait - for governments to pass and enforce legislation before they pursue "good 
practices" in support of international human rights, labour and environmental 
standards within their own operations and in the societies of which they are 
part. The public increasingly expects corporations to act in a socially 
responsible way. But it is also a business led debate, as the recent annual 
meeting of the Institute of Directors here in London illustrated.</P>
<P>With globalisation has come the growing sense that we are all responsible in 
some way for helping promote and protect the rights of our neighbours whether 
they live on the next street or on the next continent. The Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights is not simply a charter of rights, but speaks of duty in very 
broad terms. Article 29 provides: "Everyone has duties to the community …" What 
we need to do in the new century is to acknowledge that the community is no 
longer just our nearest neighbourhood but the global community.</P>
<P>Second, I wanted to indicate that good intentions clearly won't be 
enough. It is vital that the business community focuses not only on policies of 
good corporate citizenship but also their implementation in practice. If it 
really wants to prove to a growing number of sceptics that globalisation can be 
made to work not just for the privileged, but also for the powerless, it is 
practice that matters.</P>
<P>Despite the progress made at the policy level in recognising the links 
between profitable business and responsible social performance, many observers 
are still not convinced that company commitments are much more than window 
dressing in terms of the way business gets done around the world. Recent studies 
have shown that the business world has not succeeded in persuading the public 
that companies are serious about corporate social responsibility in 
practice.</P>
<P>Research published late last year by The Observer newspaper reveals high 
levels of scepticism among leaders from the voluntary sector, education, local 
government and media over companies' claims that they have improved their 
environmental and social performance. These leaders believe strongly that only 
legislation is effective. They want laws to compel companies to act responsibly. 
This significant sector of public opinion is convinced that voluntary 
approaches, though strongly favored by the private sector, are piece-meal and 
largely ineffective because only limited pressure for change can come from 
consumers, investors or campaigning groups.</P>
<P>On the environment, this debate is over whether or not business can "green 
itself from the inside". Environmental groups say it is not going to happen. 
Some of these groups are campaigning to have the Johannesburg Summit on 
Sustainable Development in August adopt proposals for an international 
convention to enforce responsible corporate behaviour. They seek an 
international regulatory framework on corporate activities as the best way to 
ensure proper respect for environmental and social standards around the 
world.</P>
<P>I would argue that it is not a simple case of choosing between voluntary or 
regulatory systems to induce corporate responsibility. If indeed we believe that 
universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour rights and the 
environment should become an integral part of business strategies and day-to-day 
operations, regulation alone will not be sufficient. It must be coupled with a 
concerted effort to stimulate good practices.</P>
<P>Regulation is crucial to minimize abuses and to enforce compliance with 
minimum norms. But regulation alone won't establish the business case for making 
necessary changes. To do so, we must provide incentives so that doing the right 
thing also makes good business sense. By focusing exclusively on regulation, 
business is driven toward the logic of managing the costs of compliance. The 
result is that society loses out on the power of business to innovate and 
establish new forms of behavior that are so desperately needed.</P>
<P>Millions of people who are denied their rights today want to enjoy them now, 
not in some distant future. To achieve that goal we will have to embrace every 
good idea, every committed partner and every possible approach that can make a 
difference.</P>
<H3>The Global Compact</H3>
<P>One way of making progress is to engage the private sector in achieving 
public goals. Engagement between the UN and civil society in furthering 
international objectives is not new. Although the number, diversity and 
influence of civil society organizations and private enterprises has grown 
markedly over the past decade, they have been interacting with the United 
Nations since its founding. Several non-governmental organizations, including 
representatives of business associations, participated in the San Francisco 
Conference of 1945.</P>
<P>Today, the UN is pursuing its engagement with the private sector on corporate 
social responsibility issues through a number of different avenues. One of the 
key initiatives is the Global Compact. Formally launched by the 
Secretary-General in July 2000, the Global Compact calls on business leaders, 
trade unions and NGOs to join forces behind a set of core values in the areas of 
human rights, labour standards and the environment.</P>
<P>Let me outline briefly what we are asking corporations to do in these three 
areas. With respect to human rights, corporations should, first, ensure that 
they support and respect human rights within their sphere of influence as set 
out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and second, ensure they are not 
themselves complicit in human rights abuses. On labour standards, businesses 
should uphold freedom of association and collective bargaining and make sure 
they are not employing under-age children or forced labour, either directly or 
indirectly, and that, in their hiring and firing policies they do not 
discriminate on grounds of race, creed, gender or ethnic origin. And in relation 
to the environment, companies should support a precautionary approach to 
environmental challenges, promote greater environmental responsibility and 
encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly 
technologies.</P>
<P>Several hundred companies from a wide range of countries North and South, 
such as Russia, China, Argentina, South Africa, Germany, Norway, Indonesia, 
Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have responded to the 
Global Compact and are working with trade unions, civil society and the UN to 
make its principles part of the strategic vision and everyday practices of 
companies in all regions. I have learned of local initiatives in discussion with 
business leaders of companies large and small in places as far apart as Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, organized by the Ethos Institute, and New Delhi, organized by the 
Institute of Indian Industry. It has been heartening to see women business 
leaders to the fore in these discussions.</P>
<P>What specifically are companies supporting the Global Compact being exhorted 
to do? As a first step, we are calling on them to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>publicly express support for the Compact and its 
  principles in mission statements and annual reports; 
  </LI><LI>post on the Global Compact website concrete examples 
  of progress made or lessons learned in implementing the Global Compact 
  principles; 
  </LI><LI>undertake activities jointly with the United Nations that advance the 
  implementation of the Compact's principles or support wider UN goals such as 
  poverty eradication. <BR></LI></UL>
<P>The Global Compact is a voluntary initiative to promote good corporate 
citizenship. I want to stress that it is not, and must not be, a mere public 
relations exercise. A commitment to the Global Compact has to lead to concrete 
actions in support of the core principles I have explained. Equally, when such 
actions are taken, a company deserves recognition.</P>
<P>But how will we know that real changes are happening? The Global Compact is 
developing a learning forum which will serve as an information bank of disparate 
experiences - some successful and some not - of company efforts to implement the 
Compact's nine principles. Through this learning approach we hope to develop the 
elements of good practice that address specific human rights, labour and 
environmental issues relevant to all industry sectors. The idea is to move 
toward a system of performance based good practices, reflecting the judgment of 
the broader international community, rather than the situation of asking 
companies simply to adhere to varied and often weak local standards and 
legislation.</P>
<P>It is too early to say whether this initiative will bring about large-scale 
improvements in business practices around the world. But I believe it is an 
experiment worth trying.</P>
<P>Many NGOs have argued that without monitoring mechanisms in place to ensure 
adherence to its principles, there can be little hope that the Global Compact 
will produce real change in performance by companies. The Global Compact does 
not substitute for other approaches that rely on monitoring and enforcement. It 
is designed to complement such approaches by giving business and other sectors 
of society space to try out new ideas, and to make a difference through 
voluntary action.</P>
<P>But clearly, to maintain its integrity, the Global Compact needs to ensure 
high standards of participation. A significant step in this direction was taken 
earlier this year with the creation of a Global Compact Advisory Council that 
brings together senior business executives, international labor leaders, and 
heads of civil society organizations from across the world. The Council is the 
first UN advisory body composed of both public and private sector leaders. Its 
task is to assist the Secretary-General in developing more precise standards of 
participation in the initiative.</P>
<P>Another step has been to strengthen links between the Global Compact and the 
Global Reporting Initiative. As you may know, the GRI was launched last month as 
an independent institution that will be based in the Netherlands. It was 
established to develop, promote, and disseminate a generally accepted framework 
for sustainability reporting on the economic, environmental and social 
performance of corporations and other organisations.</P>
<P>Social reporting has taken on significant importance in Europe and is 
increasingly seen as one important means to create the transparency through 
which companies can demonstrate that they are living up to their 
responsibilities. Companies endorsing the Global Compact principles now have in 
the GRI reporting guidelines an internationally recognised tool for fulfilling 
their Global Compact obligation to report on the steps they are taking to 
protect human rights, labour and environmental standards.</P>
<H3>The UN human rights programme and the private sector</H3>
<P>What does the learning approach advocated by the Global Compact mean for 
involving the private sector in our human rights work at the UN? Allow me to 
give you a few brief examples. At last year's World Conference against Racism, 
the Global Compact provided the framework for analysis and reflection on some 
very interesting initiatives by six companies from five continents on diversity, 
equality and non-discrimination in the workplace and surrounding communities. 
Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, participated in a high-level dialogue on these 
issues with Global Compact participating companies and other organizations on 
the opening day of the World Conference. A multi-stakeholder workshop looked at 
partnership approaches to fighting discrimination and fostering diversity and a 
panel we co-hosted with the ILO brought together trade union, company and UN 
representatives to share experiences of implementing equal-opportunity and 
diversity policies within organisations.</P>
<P>The resulting report of company experience, called 'Discrimination is 
Everybody's Business', is available on the Global Compact website. I am pleased 
to note that the initiative has inspired a number of national level initiatives 
between business and civil society that are getting underway this year.</P>
<P>My Office is also developing its role as a facilitator of dialogue with the 
private sector. Last December, for example, we hosted a workshop in Geneva 
between representatives of indigenous peoples and natural resource, energy and 
mining companies. There was a lively discussion at the workshop on the 
relationship between those companies and indigenous peoples concerning the 
questions of land, consultation and revenue sharing, which lead to 
recommendations for further study and joint action.</P>
<P>And this coming September, the committee of independent experts charged with 
monitoring the implementation of the 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
will hold a general day of discussion on 'The private sector as service provider 
and its role in implementing Child Rights'. The Committee has become 
increasingly aware of the significant role of private actors – be they 
corporations, foundations, non-governmental organizations or other institutions 
– in providing services which are vital in realising the rights of children, for 
example, to education and health.</P>
<P>It will be an opportunity to gather and facilitate the exchange of relevant 
experience on the development of public-private partnerships in providing 
services for children. The discussion will also seek to clarify how legal 
obligations of State parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are 
translated into practice when services for children are provided and/or funded 
by actors other than the State.</P>
<H3>Challenges for the future</H3>
<P>These initiatives are intended to define more clearly the boundaries of 
corporate responsibilities for human rights and to identify good practices by 
companies in contributing to their realisation. But they also raise many complex 
issues. While few would disagree that businesses are responsible for the safety 
and well-being of their employees, coming to grips with the responsibilities of 
a business outside its immediate operations but still within its 'sphere of 
influence', as it is described in the first principle of the Global Compact, has 
not yet reached the same level of agreement.</P>
<P>A new report, by the Geneva based International Council for Human Rights 
Policy, has made a useful contribution to this issue by looking at the closeness 
of the relationship between a particular company and potential victims, and 
between the company and authorities who may abuse human rights. Clearly, the 
closer the company's connection to victims of rights violations, the greater its 
duty to protect. Employees, consumers, and the communities in which the company 
operates would be within a first line of responsibility.</P>
<P>But what happens when the company is more removed from the problem? The 
urgent debate over access to HIV/AIDS drugs in developing countries has 
highlighted the extent to which pharmaceutical companies have responsibility for 
the rights of people facing life threatening disease.</P>
<P>So we are finding that the nature of the product or service, the type and 
location of the relevant consumers, the size and power of the company, the 
prevailing human rights situation in the countries where the company operates, 
in addition to the proximity to potential violations, must all be part of the 
responsibility equation.</P>
<P>Turning to the second principle of the Global Compact – the obligation of 
companies to avoid complicity in human rights abuses – may I say that I do not 
underestimate the difficulties of defining the boundaries of business 
responsibility in this context. In order to draw those boundaries, it is 
important first to understand how the concept of complicity is being used 
today.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt that a corporation which knowingly assists a State in 
violating international human rights standards could be viewed as directly 
complicit in such a violation. For example, a company that promoted, or assisted 
with, the forced relocation of people in circumstances which would constitute a 
violation of international human rights could be considered directly complicit 
in the violation. The corporation could be legally responsible if it or its 
agents knew of the likely effects of their assistance.</P>
<P>But the contemporary notion of corporate complicity in human rights abuses is 
not confined to direct involvement in the execution of illegal acts by others. 
The complicity concept has also been used to describe the corporate position in 
relation to violations by government or rebel groups when the company benefits 
from these violations. Violations committed by security forces, such as the 
suppression of peaceful protest against business activities, or the use of 
repressive measures while guarding company facilities, are often cited as 
examples of corporate complicity in human rights abuses. In legal terms, where 
human rights violations occur in the context of a business operation, the 
company need not necessarily cause the harm directly for it to become implicated 
in the abuses.</P>
<P>Perhaps most challenging is the growing expectation that companies will raise 
systematic or continuous human rights abuses with the appropriate authorities. 
Indeed, it reflects the growing acceptance by the public, and by leading 
companies, that there is something culpable about failing to exercise influence 
in such circumstances. Whether or not such silent complicity would give rise to 
a finding of a breach of a legal obligation against a company in a court of law, 
it has become increasingly clear that the moral dimension of corporate action - 
or inaction - has taken on significant importance.</P>
<P>We have, I believe, made some progress in analyzing what is meant by the key 
phrases: "sphere of influence" and "complicity in human rights abuses." These 
concepts shape the expectations on companies. They can also reflect legal 
requirements now and in the future.</P>
<P>But corporate responsibility is only part of the picture. What I want to 
stress again is that, although I am confident that initiatives like the Global 
Compact can help to build consensus and reach practical solutions to 
contemporary human rights challenges, they do not imply that the role of 
government in ensuring respect for human rights has become any less important. 
Primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights remains 
with governments. Voluntary initiatives are no substitute for government 
action.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, it is significant that parts of the UN human rights system which 
used to focus exclusively on the responsibilities of governments are now also 
addressing the role of the business sector. For example, a growing number of 
Special Rapporteurs and Independent Experts appointed by the UN Commission on 
Human Rights to study specific human rights issues around the world have sought 
to enhance contact and cooperation with the business sector in the course of 
their work. In addition, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights, an expert body of the inter-governmental Commission on Human 
Rights, is in the process of developing human rights principles for companies 
under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other universally accepted 
norms.</P>
<P>Some business representatives have argued for UN approved guidelines of 
international standards for corporate practice. Why? First, because increasingly 
global business sees advantages in having standards that are applicable in all 
countries. Second, local companies supplying many customers on the international 
market are confronted daily with the demands of 30 or more codes, not all alike, 
and they lack the resources to respond. The argument is that approval by the UN 
of one set of guidelines would give a level of authority which would make it the 
real standard and simplify and improve implementation. It has been stressed by 
some that it was important to use the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as a 
basis, since business and government needed to have a shared ultimate reference 
point. At the same time, many others fear that new regulation in this field will 
hamper development or be used for protectionist purposes.</P>
<P>I would be the first to acknowledge that regulation internationally may be 
difficult, if not impossible, to obtain in the short-term. But I believe that 
international standards will become more and more relevant in this context. Most 
of the debate centres on the existing human rights obligations generated by the 
Universal Declaration. The challenge is not to develop a new swathe of 
regulations, rather, the task is to make the human rights norms proclaimed more 
than 50 years ago relevant, influential and, most importantly, effective and 
enforceable in today's globalised world.</P>
<P>So where do we go from here? How do we address the current lack of ability in 
many countries to solve specific human rights problems through application of 
traditional sources of authority, and the need to engage other actors and 
institutions in society to work 'collaboratively' towards solutions? What human 
rights challenges may lend themselves to new approaches? What role could the RSA 
play in finding answers to these questions?</P>
<P>Let me close by suggesting three ways in which the RSA could be involved:</P>
<P>Within the Global Compact, we at the UN need partners committed to helping us 
take actions in support of the Compact's principles which can make a real 
difference in the lives of people. I would encourage all of you to consider how 
you could bring your own networks together to multiply these efforts at home and 
around the world.</P>
<P>By becoming part of the Global Compact learning forum, RSA members would have 
a new window into the challenges companies face in being both good corporate 
citizens and profitable. Perhaps you could consider sponsoring an event that 
could bring together academics, business leaders and human rights advocates to 
share experiences and plan joint action around studying the challenges of 
corporate citizenship, specifically addressing human rights issues. The Global 
Compact and my Office would be pleased to support you in such an initiative.</P>
<P>Finally, I would urge you all to consider what in practice you could do to 
support international efforts in achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals. 
Take for example the technology gap between the developed and the developing 
world. You all know that this gap is widening by the day. Research and the 
development of new technologies are overwhelmingly directed at rich country 
problems. Think of the progress that could be made in addressing the crises of 
public health, agricultural productivity, environmental degradation and 
demographic stress which so many people have to face, if the business and 
academic communities were to offer their expertise and skills to addressing the 
problems of the poorest countries of the world.</P>
<P>This encapsulates the concept contained in the Universal Declaration, that 
everyone has duties to the community. It can become one of the big ideas of this 
new century, an underlying principle that helps us shape the forces of 
globalisation in the light of shared values. It can pave the way to an ethical 
globalisation which becomes a positive experience for all the world's 
people.</P>
<P>Thank you.</P>
