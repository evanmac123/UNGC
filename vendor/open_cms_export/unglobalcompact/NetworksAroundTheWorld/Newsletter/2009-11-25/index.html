          Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010: Invitation Process and Involvement of GCLNs&nbsp;<span id="gccontent1-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
        </h3>
        <div id="gccontent1" class="switchgroup1">
          <p>
With this communication we would like to provide you with information about the preparations for the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit, to be held from 24 to 25 June in New York.
<p></p>
As you know, the Leaders Summit is the triennial gathering of the top executives of all Global Compact participants. Chaired by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010 will provide the platform for business and other Global Compact stakeholders to convene, collaborate and commit to a new era of sustainability where environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are deeply integrated into business based on both material and ethical rationales. 
<p></p>
<b>A) Invitation process and participation criteria</b>
<p></p>
1,400 leaders from participating business, civil society, governments and labour, including hundreds of chief executives, several heads of state, and approximately 100 government ministers are expected to attend the event. 
<p></p>
An invitation together with a Summit brochure (<a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/networks_around_world_doc/UNGCLeaders_Summit_2010_brochure_draft.pdf">click here for a draft version</a>) will be sent to all invitees starting by mid-December. The invitation letter will include a personalized access code for the Summit registration website to better facilitate the registration process. 
<p></p>
<em>Participation criteria are as follows:</em>
<li>Business participation at the Leaders Summit is restricted to top executives of Global Compact participants. If a company's chief executive officer is unable to participate, C-suite officers, board members or presidents (or equivalent rank) of country or regional subsidiaries are welcome instead.</li>
<li>Top executives of large companies (defined as having 250 employees or more) can bring one senior-level colleague to accompany them to the Leaders Summit.</li>
<li>All other stakeholder groups, including global civil society organizations, select business associations, academic institutions, Governments, and United Nations Agencies, will be invited by the Global Compact Office directly.</li>
<li>Registration will be confirmed by the Global Compact Office on a first-come, first-served basis, with a view to ensure adequate representation by participant sector, size, and region. To ensure that your Network is adequately represented we encourage you to reach out to your Network's champion companies to encourage them to register as early as possible. Please note that there is an early registration fee for participants who register before April 16, 2010. Please refer to the draft Leaders Summit brochure for more details about the planned sessions and logistical information such as the registration fee.</li>
<p></p>
<b>B) Role of Global Compact Local Networks</b>
<p></p>
The Leaders Summit will provide a range of opportunities to showcase the important role of Global Compact Local Networks (GCLN) in localizing the Global Compact commitment. 
<p></p>
Each established Global Compact Local Network will be invited to send one representative to attend the Summit.
<p></p>
<em>How GCLNs can prepare for the Leaders Summit:</em>
<p></p>
A number of GCLNs have informed us of exiting initiatives and activities which would be great to have highlighted at the Leaders Summit:
<li>A number of GCLNs are developing best practices publications to be launched at the Leaders Summit.</li>
<li>Some GCLNs are developing regional projects, for example, the GCLNs in Latin America are developing a report assessing the role of the private sector to the MDGs, the GCLNs China, Japan, and Korea are working on a joint research project on the materiality of corporate responsibility.</li>
<li>Also, the GCLN Syria is considering becoming a Patron Level sponsor.</li>
<p></p>
In order to provide your Network with an opportunity to showcase its activities and to attract new participants, the Leaders Summit will offer the following options:
<li><b>Exhibition space at the Leaders Summit</b>. Each Network is encouraged to showcase 1 to 2 publications (focusing on the role of the Network or best practices publications) to attract new companies to join the Local Network. The exhibition space will be organized by region. The Summit event organizer will approach you by beginning of 2010 to ask for your input as to the publications you would like to showcase. In addition, you are encouraged to provide pictures, posters, and video material of Network activities that we would like to project in the exhibition area.</li>
<li>Opportunity to showcase <b>innovative Network practices (on a country or regional level) in Summit sessions</b>. Please refer to the draft Summit brochure for the planned Summit sessions. Please note that the number of "showcasing slots" available at the Summit are extremely limited. We will provide further information regarding the criteria for selection in due course. In the meantime, please contact the Network team to discuss your proposal.</li>
<li><b>Side meetings</b>: Your Network could consider organizing a side meeting for company representatives of your country or region. We would like to encourage you to identify appropriate partners in New York (for example your country's Permanent Mission to the UN or Foreign Chamber of Commerce) to help host and organize the meeting. Please understand that for capacity reasons our office would not be able to assist you in organizing a side meeting.</li>
<p></p>
For questions on the Leaders Summit, please contact Nessa Whelan (<a href="mailto:whelan@un.org">whelan@un.org</a>) and Jonas Haertle (<a href="mailto:haertle@un.org">haertle@un.org</a>).

          <p>
            As previously communicated, the Global Compact Implementation Survey has been sent to all Global Compact participating companies on 11 November 2009. This is the "official" annual Global Compact participant survey which is featured in the Global Compact Annual Review, to be launched at the Leaders Summit in June 2010. In order to ensure completion of the survey by a high number of companies of your Local Network, we would like to encourage you to follow up with companies in the most appropriate way. Please note that the deadline for completing the survey has been extended to 11 December. Please contact <a href="mailto:ungcsurvey2009@gmail.com">ungcsurvey2009@gmail.com</a> in case of any question.
