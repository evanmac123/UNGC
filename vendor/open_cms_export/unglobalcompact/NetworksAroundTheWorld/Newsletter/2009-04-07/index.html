          Adjustment of Policy on Communication on Progress (CoP)&nbsp;<span id="gccontent2-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
        </h3>
<div id="gccontent2" class="switchgroup1">
          <p>
Beginning on 8 April, the Global Compact Office will begin communicating its refined COP policy to participants and other stakeholders. Following extensive deliberations with business and Local Networks and as discussed at last year's ALNF, the Global Compact Board, at its December 2008 meeting, has agreed to simplify the COP process, to clarify minimum requirements and to improve searchability:
</p>
<ul>1.	New business participants will be given one year from the date of joining to prepare and submit their first COP.</p>
<ul></ul>2.	During the first five years of participation, a COP must address at least two of the Global Compact’s four principle issue areas, while all must be addressed after five years. </p>
<ul></ul>3.	The COP submission form on the GC website will require additional information to improve searchability.</p>
<ul></ul>4.	The “inactive” participant status currently in use will be eliminated. Business participants that have been “non-communicating” for one year or more will be delisted and removed from the Global Compact website. </p></ul>

The <a href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NetworksAroundTheWorld/communication/2009-04-07/COP_Policy_April09.doc">attached policy provides</a> further clarification. The policy will become effective on 1 July 2009 for new business participants joining on or after this date. It will be applicable to all business participants as of 1 July 2011. 

Please visit the COP section of the Global Compact website for further information and guidance, or contact the Oliver Johner, COP Analyst in the Global Compact Office (<a href="mailto:johner@un.org">johner@un.org</a>). A comprehensive FAQ on the refined policy, as well as foreign language translations will be made available online shortly.<p></p>

    The GCO is seeking to promote the initiative and your Local Network by offering web-based briefings (webinars) for media representatives in your region.  The  purpose  of  these  webinars  is to help journalists develop  a better understanding of corporate responsibility, the mission and  activities  of  the  UN  Global Compact, and the activities of your Local Network.
    The webinars are interactive, slide-based sessions that will take at most one hour.  All that is needed to participate is access to a telephone and a computer with an Internet connection. A representative from the  GCO  will open the webinar with a presentation on CSR and the GC, followed  by  a  presentation  on  the  Local  Network  (by  a  LN representative)  and  a  question-and-answer session (the precise agenda can of  course  be  tailored  to network needs). The webinar is free of charge.  The GCO will bear all associated costs. Please note that, for now, the webinar is only available in English.
    Please contact Matthias Stausberg (<a href="mailto:stausberg@un.org">stausberg@un.org</a>) in the Global Compact Office for more information.
