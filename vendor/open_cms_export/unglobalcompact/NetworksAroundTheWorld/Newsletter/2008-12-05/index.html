          <p>
            Given that this will be the last Network Update for 2008, we would like to take this opportunity to <strong> thank our Global Compact Local Networks around the world for all of their hard work and dedication throughout the year</strong>.  Looking back, 2008 has been a very successful year for the Global Compact and for the Networks in particular. The year saw nine Network launches including Namibia, Greece, the Gulf Region and most recently Sudan.  Not only did the VI Annual Local Networks Forum allow participants to share experience and learn from each other, but it also saw important decisions taken which aim to strengthen the governance and capacity of GCLNs including the introduction of an annual agreement to manage Global Compact Local Network based on minimum criteria being met. 
          </p>
		   <p>
		   	At the broader level however, 2008 will be remembered for the financial crisis and the subsequent economic downturn.  The crisis represents a significant upheaval in the evolution of markets and the private sector. Restoring trust and confidence, and shifting to a long-term paradigm of economic value creation in the spirit of universal values should therefore be viewed as the central imperatives in the coming year. To restore momentum towards sustainable and inclusive global integration, it is more important than ever to build market legitimacy and political support based on sound ethical frameworks such as the UN Global Compact.
        </p>
		<p>Once again, thanks to all. We wish you all an enjoyable and peaceful end to the year and we look forward to an exciting and successful 2009.

         As you know from the presentation in Bonn, we are still in the development phase of the "knowledge-sharing" system which we hope will assist Networks in the development of their annual activities reports.  Therefore, rather then asking Networks to submit their annual report for 2008, we will be sending to each Network (in mid-January) an overview of their activities which have been collected throughout the year asking them to review and update where necessary.  We greatly appreciate your assistance in ensuring that the activities we have recorded for your Network are accurate and up-to-date.

          Proposed Changes to the Communication on Progress (COP) Policy&nbsp;<span id="gccontent5-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

        <div id="gccontent5" class="switchgroup1">
      <p>
         As presented and discussed at the ALNF in Bonn, the Global Compact Office proposes to clarify and strengthen the 
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NetworksAroundTheWorld/communication/2008-12-09/DRAFT_COP_Policy.pdf">COP policy</a>. 
		 The proposed changes are based on recommendations of a Global Compact Office-KPMG partnership project that included an extensive stakeholder consultation. The draft COP policy will be presented to the Global Compact Board on 15 December.

The proposed key changes are:
<ul><li>Clear and enforceable minimum requirements --> see section 3.2. on page 2</li>
<li>Self-assessment of COP by participants --> see section 5.2. on page 3; the self-assessment is a set of questions around the quality and comprehensiveness of information that is presented in the COP; the results of the self-assessment will be made public next to the COP on the website</li>
<li>New participants are required to post a COP one year after joining --> see section 6.1. on page 3</li>
<li>Removal of “inactive” status --> see section 6.4. on page 3; to maintain the pressure on companies to do COPs, the Global Compact reserves the right to make public a list of companies that were removed from the list of participants for failure to communicate on progress</li>
</ul>

              Some networks did their own national version of the statement or undertook other activities in support of the 60th anniversary. Do let <a href="mailto:lee21@un.org">Sunok Lee</a> know if this is the case so that we can give you global recognition for these activities on the UNGC's 60th anniversary webpage. We are delighted that around 150 CEOs from companies large and small from all regions and sectors signed the statement. Other business leaders wishing to add their names to the web version (the version for the FT can't fit anymore signatures) can do so at the Global Compact homepage.

              The intention is to organize series of focused country events that will bring together existing and potential signatories with policy makers, NGOs and others under the umbrella of Caring for Climate. The Global Compact will ensure that the events conducted are aligned with the Caring for Climate priorities and will provide Local Networks with the necessary information and support to organize the events. The Local Networks will be responsible for the organization of the event itself including the invitation of speakers and participants and the logistical aspects of the event. Please find

              The Private Sector Forum which was to take place in advance of the upcoming African Union Summit in January has been cancelled.  Therefore, the regional meeting for Africa which we planned to organise at the same time will no longer take place in Addis Ababa at the end of Jan.  Instead, we hope to convene the Focal Points in Africa together for a Regional Meeting at the same time as the "Fighting Corruption through Collective Action Workshop" event which will take place in Nigeria, <strong>the week of March 16-20</strong>.  We encourage you to note these dates in your diaries and we will be in touch early in the New Year with more details.
