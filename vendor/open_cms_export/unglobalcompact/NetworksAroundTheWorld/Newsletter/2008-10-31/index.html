					<h3>How Global Compact Local Networks liaise with the Global Compact Office</h3> As it was announced at the ALNF in Bonn the way Global Compact Local Networks (GCLNs) liaise with Global Compact Office (GCO) has been reorganized. As we move forward we want to make sure that all networks get the most out of the support that the GCO can give while at the same time making sure that the support is given in the best and most coherent fashion. 

Within the GCO Network team there will be two regional managers who will be responsible for the liaison with the local networks and it is organized in the following way:
Americas (North and South), Africa and Middle East will liaise with <b>Jonas Haertle </b> at <a href="mailto:haertle@un.org">haertle@un.org</a> 
Europe (East and West), Asia and Australia will liaise with <b>Nessa Whelan </b> at <a href="mailto:whelan@un.org">whelan@un.org</a>
&nbsp;<span id="gccontent1-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="gccontent1" class="switchgroup1"><p>The network team within the GCO will make sure that events and activities are registered in the Knowledge Sharing System and made available for all local networks to be shared and learned from. 

The Knowledge Sharing System as demonstrated in Bonn should be able to help you in drafting your annual activity report by the end of this year. At the next ALNF in Turkey you will be provided with full access to the system, including updating information and uploading documents on events and activities. </p></div>
			<h3>Outcomes from the VI Annual Local Network Forum, Bonn, 21-22 October 2008&nbsp;<span id="gccontent2-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3>
