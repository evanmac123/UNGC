				<p><strong>CEO Statement to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> The Global Compact Office will in the coming weeks send to all participating CEOs a letter offering the opportunity to sign a statement that would be published in the Financial Times on 10 December 2008 - Human Rights Day.&nbsp;<span id="gccontent3-title" class="handcursor">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="gccontent3" class="switchgroup1">
<p>The statement is designed to demonstrate a consensus that human rights is universally relevant to business. Through this statement, we want to help mainstream human rights and get many more businesses thinking about human rights as an important business concern.  A number of CEOs have already indicated that they would be willing to sign the statement. Achieving a good geographic and sectoral distribution of CEOs will be key.</p>
<p>The statement is as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we, business leaders from all corners of the world, call on governments to implement fully their human rights obligations.&nbsp; We also reiterate our own commitment to respect and support human rights within our sphere of influence.&nbsp; Human rights are universal and are an important business concern all over the globe.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A special <strong>"Caring for Climate"</strong> event will be organized on 10 December 2007 during the 13th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bali, Indonesia.
</p>
<p>The first meeting of Caring for Climate signatories will take place on 20-21 October 2008 at UN Headquarters in Geneva. We invite you to encourage the participants of your network to attend the event.</p>
<p>Since its launch by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in July 2007, Caring for Climate has mobilized the support of over 270 chief executives around the world with a strong interest from companies in emerging economies. The first meeting of the signatories aims to take stock of progress made and provide a business platform for sharing experiences in implementing climate strategies, lowering risk exposure and increasing business opportunities. In addition, the meeting will provide an opportunity for the signatories to meet experts and Government officials involved in designing the post-Kyoto framework and to discuss policy elements that would enable business to best address the climate challenge. 250 participants from business, civil society, Governments and the UN are expected to attend. For more information, please send an email to Lila Karbassi at <a href="mailto:karbassi@un.org">karbassi@un.org</a>.

<p>The Global Compact encourages participants to attend the <strong>Global Energy Basel</strong> - an event dedicated to integrated energy solutions - to be held on 12-14 November 2008 at the Congress Center in Basel, Switzerland. The letter attached from Georg Kell was sent to 360 selected companies including all large Caring for Climate signatories on 15 September.
