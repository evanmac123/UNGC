<p>Although there were few signatories to the Global Compact at the time, the Global Compact
Network in Turkey was formally launched in October 2002. During a special one-day event in
Istanbul, the launch was attended by the Minister of Economy and organized by UNDP together with
the Turkish Confederation of Employers Association (TISK). UNDP Turkey is exploring opportunities
to further develop the Global Compact Network in Turkey, including the establishment of facilities
and mechanisms to support the implementation of the Global Compact principles. As a first step,
UNDP Turkey has established a Global Compact National Steering Committee, consisting of a variety
of societal stakeholders, including the private sector, public sector, labour representatives, NGOs
and relevant UN agencies.</p>
<p>The Network Steering Committee is a multi-stakeholder (business, civil society, labour and the
United Nations) advisory body which provides ongoing strategic and policy advice for the
implementation of the activities of the Global Compact Network in Turkey.</p>
<p>There are three main focus points for the networkâ€™s objectives:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;
<strong>Communication</strong>: Among the Network's activities in this area is the organization of
seminars and meetings to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>promote awareness of the Global Compact within the Turkish business community,</li>
<li>inform participants of the latest developments and,</li>
<li>encourage the sharing of good practice among participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.&nbsp;
<strong>Development of Reporting Performance</strong>: The Network assists participants in the
development of the COPs and tracks performance overtime. It is also taking action to develop COP
standards and to support participants in developing Notable COPs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;
<strong>Knowledge Creation</strong>: The Network is developing an award process to inspire
participants. It is also working to produce related literature in Turkish, supporting research
institutions and the development of new approaches.
