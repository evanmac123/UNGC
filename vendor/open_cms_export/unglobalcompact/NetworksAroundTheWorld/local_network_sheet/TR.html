<p>The Global Compact was launched in Turkey in October 2002, during a special one-day event in
Istanbul that was attended by the Minister of Economy and organized by UNDP together with the
Turkish Confederation of Employers Association (TISK). UNDP Turkey is exploring opportunities to
further develop&nbsp;the Global Compact Network in Turkey, including the establishment of
facilities and mechanisms to support the implementation of the Global Compact principles. As a
first step, UNDP Turkey has established a Global Compact National Steering Committee, consisting of
a wide variety of societal stakeholders, including the private sector, public sector, labour
representatives, NGOs and relevant UN agencies.</p>
