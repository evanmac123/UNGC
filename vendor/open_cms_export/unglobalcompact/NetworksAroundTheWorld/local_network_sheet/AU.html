<a href="http://thehub.ethics.org.au/ungc/" target="_blank">information hub</a> run by the St James
Ethics Centre. 
<br />
<br />The Australian Global Compact network was formally launched on 28 May 2009 at Parliament
House in Canberra, at the National Business Leaders Forum on Sustainable Development. The launch
was conducted by Mr.Georg Kell, Executive Director of the Global Compact and Senator The Hon Nick
Sherry, Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law. The St James Ethics Centre, based in Sydney,
acts as the focal point for network coordination. 
<br />
<br />The Centre has held national consultation sessions bringing together key Signatories of the
Global Compact in Australia. There is a large pool of diverse signatories to draw on in Australia
including large and small corporations, industry organisations, NGOs, and academic institutions.
These sessions have provided valuable and practical ideas as the network builds size and
capability. 
<br />
<br />The network will seek to hold regular educational events and to provide networking
opportunities for local signatories. In addition, it will seek through its actions to be an
important voice to Government decision-making, in terms of the Global Compact principles and their
interaction with business.
