<p>The Netherlands Network (GCNL) was jointly founded by ABN AMRO, Shell, TNT and Unilever in April
2006. A Secretariat has been established within the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and
Employers (VNO-NCW). The network steering committee of approximately 10 persons is comprised of
representatives from Global Compact signatories, NGOs, government and the International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC). The network is focused on raising awareness of the GC in the Netherlands and
providing a valuable learning and action platform for signatories.</p>
