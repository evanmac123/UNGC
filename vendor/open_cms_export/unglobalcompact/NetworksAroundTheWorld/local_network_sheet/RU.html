round table organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Union of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs in partnership with UNDP and other UN agencies. Since then Russian Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs jointly with UNDP focused their efforts on developing an active
network in Russia.&nbsp; 
<br />
<br />On 10 April 2008 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attended the re-launch of the Global
Compact Network in Russia during his meeting with over 30 top executives of Russian businesses. 
<br />
<br />The role of the Russian network will be to facilitate the progress of companies engaged in
the Global Compact with respect to implementation of the ten principles, while also creating
opportunities for multi-stakeholder engagement and collective action. 
<br />
<br />There are currently 24 members of the Global Compact in Russia, including big companies such
as the United Company Russian Aluminum, the Russian Railways, Interros Group of companies, Renova,
Sistema as well as the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) and several NGOs.
