<p>The Global Compact Nordic Network is one of the first local network that was formed. Companies
from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden initially formed the Nordic Network (GCNN) as a forum to
discuss the implementation of the Global Compact. The network&nbsp;has since then held regular
meetings twice a year, forming working groups and organising other Global Compact related
activities. A recent event included a seminar on human rights and responsibility in the supply
chain.</p>
<p>In 2007, network meetings were held in Oslo and in Stockholm.</p>
