<p>The Global Compact was launched in Croatia on March 20, 2007. The majority of&nbsp;the
Networks'&nbsp;activities so&nbsp;far have&nbsp;consisted of outreach events. The network
participants are overwhelmingly from the business sector, but include all relevant business
associations, major business schools, and a few civil society organizations. They include the
majority of large domestic companies, multinationals/ their HQ or subsidiaries in Croatia, and a
number of SMEs with a developed responsible business practices. The initiative was launched under
the auspices of the President of the Republic, and with his participation.</p>
<p>At present, the UNDP Croatia/Business Partnerships Program is serving as network secretariat. No
steering committee is currently in place, but its establishment is envisaged for the next year.
