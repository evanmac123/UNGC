(NBI) acts as Focal Point of the Global Compact Local Network South Africa The NBI is a voluntary
coalition of 140 companies in South Africa committed to shared and sustainable development. 
<br />
<h3>Leading institutions and companies developing the Global Compact in South Africa</h3>The NBI as
Focal Point is supported by dedicated participants such as Sasol, Eskom, Barloworld and Deloitte,
as well as Business Unity South Africa (BUSA), the UNISA Centre for Corporate Citizenship, the UNGC
Regional Learning Forum and national government departments. The NBI also looks forward to forging
stronger partnerships with civil society. 
<br />
<h3>Governance structure</h3>One of the first activities of the new Focal Point will be the
creation of an Advisory Board.
<br />
<h3>Activities/Events</h3>The Network will focus on increasing participation in the Global Compact,
as well as raising the number of published CoPs. It will also seek stronger local commitment in
order to achieve effective collective action. The primary mechanism for this will be a series of
focused events endorsed by the Board. The Focal Point will also work towards greater public and
media awareness of the Compact.
<br />
<br />To date, the Network has hosted events on anti-corruption, social investment, and HIV/Aids.
