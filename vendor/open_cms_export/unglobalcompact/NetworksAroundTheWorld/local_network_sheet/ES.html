<br />On 15 November 2004, during its third General Assembly, the Spanish Global Compact Network
formed the Asociación Española del Pacto Mundial de las Naciones Unidas (ASEPAM), becoming only the
second network worldwide (after India) to seek legal status as a chartered organization. The
creation of this governance model was a response to the ever-growing level of activities of the
Global Compact movement in Spain, which includes “The Square Table,” a functional multi-stakeholder
tool for dialogue, as well as the Learning Forums already in operation.</p>
<p>ASEPAM’S members are expected to progress towards excellence in the fulfillment of the ten
principles and in observing the integrity measures of the Global Compact. A membership fee was
introduced to support the association’s operations. In turn, members can participate in all
activities undertaken by the association (e.g. learning, dialogue and networking events), and
receive the right to vote and stand as candidates in both the Executive Committee and the General
Assembly of the association. ASEPAM will also play a key role in collecting companies’
communications on progress and in addressing dilemma situation involving Spanish businesses.</p>
