<font face="Arial">The Global Compact in Spain was launched in 2002 at the same time as the Kofi
Annan’s official visit to Madrid. Thanks to the Fundación Rafael del Pino, 135 entities endorsed
the Global Compact initiative known in Spain as “El Pacto Mundial de Naciones Unidas”.</font> 
<font face="Arial">In 2003 a Coordination Committee was created as an incentive for learning and
dialogue amongst companies and their stakeholders, Labour Unions, NGOs, Academic Participants,
Public Sectors, Business Associations and others organizations involved.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Finally, on 15 November 2004, during its third General Assembly, the Spanish
Global Compact Network formed the “Asociación Española del Pacto Mundial de las Naciones Unidas”,
becoming only the second network worldwide (after India) to seek legal status as a chartered
organization.&nbsp; A steering Committee of 21 members was created to manage the coordination and
the strategic management of the Spanish Network.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">The Spanish Network’s members are expected to progress towards excellence in the
fulfillment of the ten principles and in observing the integrity measures of the Global Compact.
The Spanish Network undertakes activities such as 
<a href="http://www.pactomundial.org/index.asp?MP=5&amp;MS=10&amp;MN=2">learning and dialogue
forums</a>

practice</a>, 
<a href="http://www.pactomundial.org/index.asp?MP=5&amp;MS=32&amp;MN=2">Regional Presentation of
Global Compact</a> around the country and a “Communication on Progress (COP) Workshop”. They also
promote Global Compact initiatives amongst participants and organize 
<a href="http://www.pactomundial.org/index.asp?MP=5&amp;MS=13&amp;MN=2">working groups on key
issues</a>.</font>
</p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Main achievements: the Spanish Network has elaborated a specific COP for large
companies as well as a COP for SME and others organizations to promote transparency and
communication.&nbsp; The 5th Anniversary of the Spanish Network was celebrated with the
Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon and some of the leading companies of the Network. As a key
organization on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Spain, the Spanish Network has been
invited to participate vocally in the State Council on CSR of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
