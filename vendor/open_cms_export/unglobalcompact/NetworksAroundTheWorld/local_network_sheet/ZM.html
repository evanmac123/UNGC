<p>The Global Compact was first introduced to Zambia in 2002. A Steering Committee was established,
consisting of representatives from business, government, donors, multilateral NGOs, the UN system
and civil society.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Global Compact Local Network in Zambia was launched on 11th March 2002 by the former French
Ambassador to Zambia H. E. Excellency Jean Paul Monchau, former UN Country Representative Ms.
Olubanke King Akerele, and Deputy Finance Minister Hon. Felix Mutati and Hon. Kafumukache
representing the government.&nbsp;A Steering Committed was created, headed by former UN Country
Representative Ms Olubanke King. Leading companies and institutions include: Total Zambia Limited,
Tata Zambia Ltd, Zambia Investment Centre, Stanbic Bank Zambia Limited, Zambia Export Growers
Association, Zambia Export Board, Bank of Zambia.</p>
<p>Global Compact Zambia is governed by a Board of Directors from participating companies, and the
Co-chair is the Indian High Commissioner to Zambia.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Global Compact Zambia has three main objectives:
<br />1.&nbsp;Investment/Export Promotion, Market Access, Tourism Promotion and Environmental
Protection.
<br />2.&nbsp;Business Partnerships in Developing and Promoting HIV/AIDS Programmes in the
workplaces
<br />3.&nbsp;Linking the Global Compact with NEPAD, MDGs</p>
<h3>Key Activities Include</h3>
<ul>
<li>HIV/AIDS workplace Programme: Global Compact Zambia has been involved in the HIV/AIDS
sensitization in the workplace since October, 2004 till date.&nbsp;This project is done in
collaboration with Zambia National Aids Network.&nbsp;More than 27,146 workers have been sensitized
in various sectors of the economy, i. e. mining, agriculture, manufacturing industries and service
industry such as hotels, security firms etc.
<br />
<br />To make the HIV/AIDS programme sustainable, Global Compact Zambia Network trains peer
educators from various companies who act as focal point persons in their various
organizations.&nbsp;HIV/AIDS being complex, Global Compact&nbsp;has also developed&nbsp;
partnership with other organizations such as the Lusaka District Health Board for the supply of
condoms&nbsp;and educational which are then distributed in various companies.
<br />
<br />The main achievement of this project is that, more companies have put in place HIV/AIDS
workplace policy and they have more information on HIV/AIDS through the trained peer
educators.&nbsp;Usually after the awareness talks more people express their wish to be tested for
HIV/AIDS.
<br /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MDGs &amp; Private Sector: Global Compact in collaboration with United Nations Development
Programme organize workshops on the “ Role of the Private Sector in Achieving the MDGs”.&nbsp;These
workshops are held across the country and attract various stakeholders from the government, private
sector and civil Society.&nbsp;The main objective is to sensitize the private sector on how they
can assist in achieving the MDGs by 2015. The added advantage is that the government is present at
these meetings by a senior government officer, usually the Minister of Finance and National
Planning.
<br />
<br />The main achievement of this is that more companies, especially multinationals, are engaged
in various CSR activities, such as rehabilitating schools, hospitals, improving water and
sanitation and offering of scholarships to vulnerable children just to mention a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the other hand, the government gets a better understanding of how it can assist the private sector
through its various policies.
<br /></li>
<li>Business Linkages: To assist the small entrepreneurs, the Local Network in Zambia mobilizes
SMEs for business linkages.&nbsp;This is done through the UNDP Growing Sustainable Business
Initiative. The main achievements is that more big businesses are willing to work with SMEs.</li>
