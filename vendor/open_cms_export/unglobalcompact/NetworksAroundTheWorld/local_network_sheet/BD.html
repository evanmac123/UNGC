Bangladesh on 26th January 2009, at a ceremony jointly organized by the Bangladesh Enterprise
Institute (BEI), the CSR Centre, and the UNDP Dhaka office.
<br />
<br />The event brought together roughly 150 representatives of business, government and civil
society, including the 41 existing Global Compact participants from Bangladesh. The launch was
followed by a roundtable discussion to further set the stage for CSR efforts in Bangladesh.
<br />
<br />UNGC participants in Bangladesh include small, large and medium business houses, business
chambers, banks, academics, multinationals, non governmental organizations, national think tanks,
media, etc. The Centre with its partners BEI and UNDP has chalked out a two year program in order
to create a positive business environment by enhancing the awareness and need for the UNGC
Bangladesh Network.
<br />
<br />The Centre has been in dialogue with a number of stakeholders especially on the issues of
creating global links for women entrepreneurs with emphasis on compliance and identifying access to
wider markets at local and national levels. This will be one of the ongoing initiatives of the
Centre this year. Another focus will be on environmental issues geared to climate change in
Bangladesh. Apart from these initiatives the Centre will continue with its ongoing programmes.
