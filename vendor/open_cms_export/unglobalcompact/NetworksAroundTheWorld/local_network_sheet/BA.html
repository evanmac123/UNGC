was launched by UNDP and Foreign Trade Chamber in September 2005, when 24 national and
multinational companies joined to the initiative. Global Compact is the first initiative for
advancing corporate social responsibility in the country and as such has attained considerable
effect by reaching its main initial goal - to define all relevant parties and partners that could
contribute to the initiative and to spread the spirit of ethical corporate citizenship within
business community. 
<p>The local network is being administered and leaded by UNDP Bosnia-Herzegovina. In context of
governance, the Steering Committee of local network was established at the first membersâ€™ meeting
in 2005 and is consisted of most influential BiH companies, United Nation Development Program and
Foreign Trade Chamber.
<br /></p>
<p>Since&nbsp;the launch of Global Compact in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the initiative has been promoted
through events organized in local communities and through individual meetings with
stakeholders.&nbsp;Given that&nbsp;the Global Compact is the first initiative aiming to advance
corporate social responsibility in the country, these events&nbsp;initiated a broad discussion on
corporate citizenship in BiH context and identified the greatest challenges to sustainable
development.</p>
<p>The Local network is also used for sharing information related to implementation of ISO and
environmental standards; anti-corruption activities; and how to promote a more favorable business
climate in BiH. The network facilitates contacts and partnerships among all of the Global Compact
stakeholders; Businesses, Civil Society, Academia, and the United Nations.</p>
