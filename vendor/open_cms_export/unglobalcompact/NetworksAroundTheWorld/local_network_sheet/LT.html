and&nbsp;emerged from the Group of Initiative on responsible business, established at the
conference “Responsible Business in Society”, hosted by the President of the Republic of Lithuania
H.E. Valdas Adamkus in autumn 2004. 
<p>The Lithuanian Network seeks to improve business strategy of participating companies, serve as
discussion, exchange and learning forum for responsible businesses and, together with the United
Nations, Government, non-governmental sector develop solutions to social and environmental problems
and thereby contributing to more inclusive development of economy. The main mission of the Network
is to promote the vision and development of responsible business as a condition for sustainable
development in Lithuania. The network provides a common framework where companies can share
knowledge, expertise, and innovations in business operation, as well as initiate and implement
joint projects.</p>
<p>The Network operates as an entirely voluntary initiative. 42 Lithuanian and multinational
companies and organisations were members of the Network as of November 2006. Among the members,
there are representatives of financial, insurance, telecommunications, textile, chemical and other
industries, consultations and other sectors, associations, trade unions and a few academic
institutions.</p>
<p>The activity of the Network includes regular meetings to exchange information once per month and
annual meeting organised once per year. The Network convenes thematic events on the implementation
of the Global Compact and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) principles. During 2006, thematic
forums were devoted to consultations on CSR and labour standards. Members of the Network use
collective action against existing or emerging problems in business, thereby calling the attention
of other business representatives and the Government and inviting for joint actions in resolution
of these problems (e.g. open statement of June 2006 against payment of salaries without paying
taxes to the state).</p>
<p>The Local Network is an informal forum without strictly defined governance structure and no
membership fees. Currently, the Network is facilitated by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) in Lithuania. While UNDP was convening the first meetings of the Network, the members
introduced later on a rotating chairing and venue, which change for each meeting to be convened in
a different company/organization. Starting from 2007, the Network will be lead by one of the
companies &ndash; members of the Network on rotation basis for 6 months.</p>
<p>Companies and organisations that believe in sustainable development and responsible business,
respect human and labour rights of employees, protect the environment, disagree with corruption,
take interest in the development of sustainable business strategies and civil society may become
members of the Network after officially joining the UN Global Compact Initiative.</p>
