community joined together with representatives from government, UNDP and civil society to launch a
UN Global Compact Local Network. Several issues are driving the corporate responsibility agenda in
Slovakia, including reducing barriers to employment for disadvantaged groups, promoting greater
environmental responsibility and fighting corruption. 
<br />
<br />The Global Compact Network Slovakia was launched under the auspices of H. E. Mr. Dušan
Čaplovič, Deputy Prime Minister for Knowledge-Based Society, European Affairs, Human Rights and
Minorities. According to Čaplovič, joining the Global Compact shows that Slovak companies, and
those operating in Slovakia, are increasingly understanding their “responsibility towards
employees, the region, society, state and the world”. 
<br />
<br />At the Global Compact launch, the Slovak National Strategy for CSR Support was presented
publicly for the first time. The Strategy, which is being implemented as part of a broader European
Union plan, seeks to increase the competitiveness of the Slovak business environment, support
transparency and improve the quality of life in Slovakia.
