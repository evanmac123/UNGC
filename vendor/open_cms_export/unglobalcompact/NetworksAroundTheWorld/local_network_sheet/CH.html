<p>On 17 March 2006, the Swiss signatories of the UN Global Compact agreed to develop their common
activities as an official local network. The network will promote collective action and
multi-stakeholder dialogue on the basis of in-depth exchanges of experiences. As a show of support
for the signatory-led effort, the network will be domiciled in the offices of ICC Switzerland.</p>
