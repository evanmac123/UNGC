officially launched on 21 December 2003, under the stewardship of the United Nations Information
Center (UNIC) in Tokyo. In April 2008 GC-JN changed its organizational structure into an
independent business-led network. A Local Network Board was established to provide strategic
direction. With the continued support of UNIC, GC-JN functions as a dynamic learning platform in
providing Japanese companies with the opportunity to share their corporate responsibility
practices. 
<br /> 
<br />Companies and other stakeholders that are interested in participating in the network are
asked to contact GC-JN directly.
