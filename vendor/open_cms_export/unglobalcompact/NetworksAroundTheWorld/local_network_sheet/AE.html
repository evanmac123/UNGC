Dubai. The Network was established with the following main goals:
<br />
<ul>

<li>To raise local CSR practice to international benchmarks</li>
<li>To rally the support and participation of the members of the GCC Local Network</li>
<li>To create opportunities for multi-stakeholder dialogue, learning and collective actions</li>
</ul>
