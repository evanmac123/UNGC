<p>
<br /> The German Global Compact network seeks to promote multi-stakeholder dialogue and
constructive cooperation between government, business and other sectors of society in the fields
of:</p>
<ul>
<li>LEARNING: Assist companies with the implementation and internalisation of the ten principles;
communicate best practices; strengthen exchange between academic research and practice; organize
joint events</li>
<li>POLICY DIALOGUES: Act as a focal point for government and civil society organisations;
facilitate dialogue and exchange among all stakeholders such as seminars or roundtable discussions,
disseminate information about CSR-trends and activities</li>
<li>OUTREACH / NETWORKS: Motivate companies to become signatories of the GC; liaise with other
Global Compact networks worldwide and the GC Office in New York; provide media contacts,
communication and public relations</li>
<li>PROJECTS: Develop partnership projects</li>
</ul>
<p>GTZ, the German development cooperation agency, is the coordinator of the German GC Network. On
an annual basis, GTZ hosts national Global Compact events for companies to describe how the GC
principles have been translated into business practice and how they communicate their process. In
June 2004 the network participants identified areas of common interest among companies, NGOs and
public sector such as how to translate the tenth principle Transparency and the Fight against
corruption” into business practice or how to define the “business case for CSR”.</p>
<p>Right from the start German business and the German government participated in the Global
Compact initiative and consistently expressed a strong commitment to support GC activities. In June
2000 a selected number of German companies joined to create an informal business network “The
German Friends of the Global Compact”, which provided crucial assistance to the International GC
Learning Forum meeting in Berlin in December 2002. It is facilitated by the International Chamber
of Commerce (ICC Germany). The establishment of the informal business network was and is still
motivated by the possibility</p>
<ul>
<li>to share information about GC-related activities</li>
<li>to support the GC Initiative jointly&nbsp;</li>
<li>to discuss questions which arise while the GC-Initiative develops</li>
<li>to discuss the role of the business network and its future development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Friends of the GC" are part of the wider German GC-network, which is composed of companies,
industry associations, NGOs, private foundations, the public sector, research and academic
institutions.Current stakeholders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies</li>
