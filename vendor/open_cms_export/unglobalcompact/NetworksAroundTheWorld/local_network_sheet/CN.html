Global Compact in Chinese</a>
<br />
<br />The Global Compact was formally introduced to China through a high level meeting in Beijing
held in December 2001, hosted by the China Enterprise Confederation with the cooperation of the
United Nations system in China, the UNDP and the Global Compact office. This historic meeting was
chaired by Mr. Chen Jinhua, President of the CEC, and Mr. Deng Pufang, President of the China
Disabled Persons Federation.
<br />
<br />In the following year, under the guidance of Mr Wang Zhaoguo, Chairman of the China Society
for the Promotion of the Guangcai Programme and Mr. Jing Shuping, Chairman of the All China
Federation of Industry and Commerce, a meeting under the chairmanship of Mr. Hu Deping was held in
Xiâ€™an to introduce the Global Compact to the members of these organizations.
<br />
<br />The Global Compact Local Network China was formally launched on 20 April 2009 as an
independent organization with formal legal registration. The ceremony in Beijing was attended by a
large number of business leaders, as well as senior government officials and civil society
representatives. Global Compact Board member Chen Ying was confirmed as the first director of the
new network. 
<br />
<br />Chinese companies have been engaged in the Global Compact from its inception. In recent
years, a large number of both state-owned and private companies joined the initiative, bringing the
total number of Chinese participants to over 200. More and more companies are implementing the GC
and disclosing performance changes through the COP.
