<p>Following&nbsp;the first Sponsors' Meeting on 2 July 2007 and its official&nbsp;establishment on
4 September 2007,&nbsp;the Global Compact Korea Network organized its Inauguration Ceremony and the
first Annual General Meeting of the network on 17 September 2007. This concluded a comprehensive
18-month outreach effort to promote the worldâ€™s largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative
in Korea. Since then, various activities have been launched to raise awareness on the Global
Compact and its ten principles. The Korea Network is now working with more than 120 participating
