<p>The Global Compact was launched in India at a high-level meeting of Business Leaders in Mumbai
on 4 December, 2000 and over 100 leading organizations from India have joined the initiative to
date. During the initial phase of GC development in India, participants met in informal Networks
both in Mumbai and in New Delhi. However, participants felt that an institutional framework was
needed for organizations to exchange experiences and engage in joint activities to implement the
Global Compact principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, 2003 the 
<a href="http://www.globalcompactindia.org/" target="_blank">Global Compact Society (GCS)</a> was
formed and registered in New Delhi as an all India forum for organizations participating in the UN
Global Compact.&nbsp; Thus far, 41 Indian organizations from public and private sector companies,
professional bodies and institutions have joined the Society as founding members and a Governing
Committee has been established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, 2007 the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)&nbsp;and the Global Compact Office
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the CII formally strengthened its commitment to
advancing the principles of the UN Global Compact &ndash; both in India and around the world.&nbsp; CII
further pledged to build the capacity of corporations operating in India and around the world to
implement the principles of the Global Compact within their business operations, and to leverage
the delivery capacity of the Global Compact through the organization’s “ Centres of Excellence”.
