participation of about 60 business executives of major multinational and domestic companies as well
as heads of major employersâ€™ organizations and the Minister of Labor. At a meeting held in the
Ministry of Social Affairs a Steering Committee was established. The Steering Committee is an
informal group of representatives of the Polish business, currently consisting of 15 companies. The
main objectives of the Steering Committee are to promote Global Compact and corporate social
responsibility as well as to encourage companies to accept and put into practice the principles of
Global Compact. The Steering Committee also implements joint projects to solve specific problems in
various social areas.
