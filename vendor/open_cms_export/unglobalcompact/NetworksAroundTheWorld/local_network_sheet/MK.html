<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The GC in Macedonia was launched on Wednesday, 22nd December, 2004. The process was initiated in
May 2004 leading to acceptance of Global Compact principles by 25 Macedonian companies at the end
of 2004.</p>
<p>In May 2006, a meeting of the Macedonian GC Network was held in Skopje, where the governance
structure was discussed, and the establishment of an Advisory Board and Secretariat was proposed.
The governance structure was finalized, by constitution of the Advisory Board and approval of the
Act of the network, as well as activity plan in October 2006, with the first meeting of the Board
of the Macedonian Global Compact network.</p>
<h3>Activities/Events</h3>
<p>The objectives and the activities of the network to promote the Global Compact
principles&nbsp;and ensure that they become part of the business strategy, culture and day-to-day
activities of the Macedonian business community.</p>
<p>Several activities were undertaken in 2006:
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed and agreed on the preferred governance structure</li>
<li>Set the rules/structures/tools of the GC Network</li>
<li>Reporting</li>
<li>Short and mid term actions, including: 2 workshops: one focused on implementation of GC
principles, and the second was focused on environmental principles and the implementation of IPPC
(Integrated Pollution Prevention Control) as a joint effort of GC, UNDP “Environment” program and
the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning.</li>
<li>A partnership among UNDP and On.Net was initiated and established during 2006. The primary goal
of this partnership was strengthening the enhancement of the economic environment on a local level,
improvement of conditions for economic regeneration, environmental protection and promotion of
public-private partnerships, resulting in sustainable job creation. A Global Compact member, On
Net, and UNDP Macedonia agreed to establish close cooperation, through sharing and coordination of
resources and expertise. The partnership project has been realized through implementation within
UNDP Projects that aim to do so, called "Employment Mediation".</li>
</ul>
<p>Having in mind that the obligation for the first reporting on GC activities &ndash; preparation of
Communication on Progress is due for the companies that firstly joined the GC, assistance in this
area was provided, as well as assistance in acceptance and implementation of the Code of
Conduct.</p>
<p>Last year, a comprehensive study about CSR experiences and needs was undertaken.&nbsp; The
acquisition of data has been carried out by using three methodological procedures: A poll was
conducted covering 100 companies, two focus groups consisting of representatives of the media and
the NGO-s were interviewed and a poll conducted among representatives of economic chambers. The
report contains analysis of the results obtained from the investigation regarding the extent of
their dedication, knowledge and participation in CSR, activities that have so far been realized in
this field, their further interests, including barriers and motivations that could stimulate or
prevent them for further action in the sphere of CSR.</p>
<p>Additionally, in May and in November 2005, two forums on Corporate Social Responsibility were
organized, as a joint effort of Macedonian Corporate Governance Council and Global Compact Network
in Macedonia. The Conferences brought together high government officials, Trade Unions
representatives, as well as representatives from business community in Macedonia, and civil society
groups, business associations, NGOs, donor community, medias.</p>
<p>The Directory of the Macedonian Global Compact Network was prepared and presented during the
Second Conference on CSR in 2005. The preparation of the Directory of the Macedonian Global Compact
was a major step in activities the companies undertake towards generating knowledge and experience
about reporting. It is the first time that corporate social responsibility activities are being
presented and published in Macedonia.
