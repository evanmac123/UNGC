please share the information contained below with all interested parties

GLOBAL NEWS

1. New integrity measure: Participant screening by Local Networks
In a further effort to ensure that the UN Global Compact bolsters the 
integrity of the United Nations and does not in any way undermine it, we 
would like to introduce a new participant screening process which directly 
involves GC Local Networks. When a new signatory letter from an 
organisation is received by the GCO, there will be a brief period of time 
before the organisation is accepted and entered into the database as a GC 
participant. This time, during which the organisation's application is 
considered "pending", will be used to conduct our own screening measures 
and to seek the advice of the Local Network. The Focal Point of the 
relevant country will be informed of the organisation's application and 
will be granted up to one week to raise any issues or concerns that may be 
relevant when considering whether the organisation should be accepted as a 
GC participant. If no issues are raised by the Network or as a result of 
our internal integrity measures within the one week time-frame, the 
applicant will automatically be accepted as a GC participant. 

2. Save the Date: VI Annual Local Networks Forum
Kindly note that the VI Annual Local Networks Forum for LN representatives 
is going to take place on 21-22 October 2008 in Bonn, Germany.
This year's Forum is being organized by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für 
Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Government in 
collaboration with the Fundació Fòrum - Barcelona Center for the Support 
of the UN Global Compact and the Global Compact Office. 
Following the tradition of previous years, the VI Annual Local Networks 
Forum will bring Local Network focal points and company representatives 
together to share experiences, learn from each other and network. It is 
intended that this year's meeting will also provide the opportunity to 
seek the input of Local Networks on key governance issues relating to 
Local Networks and ALNF's link to the GC initiative's multi-centric 
governance framework. More detailed information on the ALNF will be 
circulated in due course.  We are looking forward to seeing you all in 
Germany in October.

3. 2008 Global Compact Implementation Survey
On March 31, the Global Compact Office will be emailing all business 
participants asking them to complete the 2008 Global Compact 
Implementation Survey online. Each company will receive a unique web link 
to the survey (in English, French, Spanish and Chinese). 
This annual survey serves as an important benchmark – showing where 
progress has been made, identifying new or growing areas of priority, and 
pointing to issues that are challenging for business to address. 
Additionally, the survey asks companies to tell the Global Compact how we 
can best support your efforts to implement the ten principles. The survey 
provides important input for our Annual Review – as well as helping the 
Global Compact Office to prioritize and guide the development of future 
resources, dialogues and learning events. It is very important, therefore, 
that we have a high response rate. 

We hope that you will encourage all companies within your network to 
complete the online survey by 15 April (PDF copies of the survey are 
attached for your convenience). Please email survey@unglobalcompact.org if 
you have any questions about the survey.
